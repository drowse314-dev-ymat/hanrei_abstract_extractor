    <Abstract>1. Where a live-in caretaker of a condominium was intermittently engaged in certain duties during some hours before and after the scheduled working hours, given the facts that (i) the employer instructed the caretaker to perform, at scheduled times during these hours outside the scheduled working hours, the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office, locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, turning on and off the air-conditioners, etc., (ii) the manual prepared by the employer stated that the caretaker should respond to requests from residents, etc. for receipt and delivery of parcels, etc. at any time even outside the scheduled working hours, and (iii) the employer received periodical reports on his/her duties from the caretaker and recognized the fact that the caretaker actually responded to requests from residents, etc. even outside the scheduled working hours, the caretaker should be deemed to have been under the control of the employer during these hours outside the described working hours, including the hours during which the caretaker stayed in the room next to the caretaker's office and was not actually engaged in work, and therefore these hours should be regarded as working hours for the purpose of Article 32 of the Labor Standards Act.<br/><br/>
2. Where a husband and wife who worked as live-in caretakers of a condominium were, under instruction of their employer, engaged in the same duties on Saturdays, which is designated as a day off under their employment contract, as those duties to be performed on weekdays, given the facts that the employer gave clear instruction to the caretakers that only one of them should be engaged in work on Saturdays, and they consented to this instruction, and that the volume of duties on Saturdays cannot be deemed to be too large to be handled by a single person, it is appropriate to calculate the number of working hours on Saturdays by deeming that only either one of them was engaged in their duties.<br/><br/>
3. Where a live-in caretaker of a condominium was intermittently engaged in certain duties on days designated as days off under his/her employment contract other than Saturdays, given the facts that the employer did not clearly instruct the caretakers to perform the duties on such days off except for the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office and locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, only the hours during which the caretakers were actually engaged in the duties that the employer explicitly or implicitly instructed him/her to perform should be regarded as working hours for the purpose of Article 32 of the Labor Standards Act.</Abstract>

    <FullText>Main text:
The judgment of prior instance is quashed with respect to the part for which the appellant of final appeal lost the case.<br/>
This case is remanded to the Tokyo High Court with respect to the part mentioned in the preceding paragraph.
Reasons:
Concerning the reasons for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsel, KAMO Yoshihito, et al.<br/>
1. In this case, the appellee of final appeal, who worked with her late husband as live-in caretakers of a condominium, alleges that for their overtime work and work on days off, they did not receive the extra allowances prescribed in the rules of employment other than only part of them which were paid as special allowances, and seeks payment of the outstanding amount of extra allowances (including the amount inherited from her late husband) from the appellant of final appeal.<br/><br/>
2. The outline of the facts determined by the court of second instance is as follows:<br/>
(1) The parties concerned<br/>
(a) Stock Company A (hereinafter referred to as the "Company") was a company engaged in management of building environments and sanitation, security services for buildings, and general management of condominiums. On July 1, 2005, the Company was taken over by the appellant through an absorption-type merger, and the appellant succeeded to the Company's rights and obligations.<br/>
(b) B and the appellee were husband and wife (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "appellee and her husband"), and they were employed by the Company under the employment contract described in (3) below. B died on June 27, 2000, and the appellee inherited his claim for wage payment against the Company.<br/>
(2) Management service contract concluded between the Company and the residents' association<br/>
(a) The Company was entrusted by the residents' association for a condominium named XX and located in Kita-ku, Tokyo (hereinafter referred to as the "Condominium") with the management services for the Condominium (the contract concluded therefore is hereinafter referred to as the "Management Service Contract").<br/>
The Condominium is a 13-story reinforced concrete building. The first and second floors of the building are leased for use as a supermarket and other stores and company offices (these leased parts of the building are hereinafter referred to as the "Leased Space"), and all of the residential units on the third to 13th floors (126 units) have been sold out.<br/>
(b) The Management Service Contract, with regard to how the caretakers of the Condominium should perform their duties, provided that the caretakers shall live and work in the condominium, that the caretakers shall work from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m., that the caretakers shall have days off on Sundays and national holidays, and have paid leaves (including days of leave for mourning, summer holidays, and year-end and new-year holidays), and that the caretakers shall be engaged in work at the caretaker's office.<br/>
(3) Employment contract concluded between the Company and the appellee and her husband<br/>
(a) On March 1, 1997, the appellee and her husband were employed by the Company as condominium caretakers (the contract concluded therefor is hereinafter referred to as the "Employment Contract"), and during the period from March 10, 1997 until September 14, 2000 (or until June 27, 2000, in the case of B), they lived and worked in the Condominium.<br/>
Although it was basically possible for a single person to perform the caretaker's duties because the caretaker was actually engaged in work only for limited hours and the caretaker's duties were easy to perform, the Company employed both the appellee and her husband as caretakers so that when either one of them was out of the caretaker's office for patrol or other work, the other was able to deal with visitors or perform other duties at the caretaker's office.<br/>
(b) Upon employing the appellee and her husband, the division director and other personnel in charge at the Company explained to the appellee and her husband the content of their duties, using the "Condominium Caretaker's Manual" prepared by the Condominium Management Companies Association, and also provided them with another manual (prepared by the said division director based on the reports from the preceding caretakers; hereinafter referred to as the "Company's Manual").<br/>
(4) Provisions of the rules of employment, etc.<br/>
(a) The rules of employment applied by the Company provided as follows: (i) The scheduled working hours shall be eight hours per day (starting at 9:00 a.m. and ending at 6:00 p.m., with a rest hour from noon until 1:00 p.m.); (ii) Days off shall be a statutory day off per week (Sunday) and non-statutory days off (e.g. Saturdays, national holidays, summer holidays, year-end and new-year holidays, etc.); (iii) a substitute day off may be given for working on a day off.<br/>
(b) Under the rules of payment applied by the Company, the amount of extra allowance shall be calculated by multiplying the base amount for extra allowance (as calculated by dividing the base wage by the average number of scheduled working hours per month for the relevant business year) by any of the following rates of extra allowance:<br/>
(i) For working over the scheduled working hours on a workday: 125%<br/>
(ii) For working on a statutory day off: 135%<br/>
(iii) For working on a non-statutory day off: 125%<br/>
(c) Under the Employment Contract, the Company paid the appellee and her husband the base wage (base pay and supplemental pay) on the monthly date of wage payment, and also paid them special allowance (15,000 yen to B and 10,000 yen to the appellee) in lieu of their extra allowances.<br/>
(5) Instructions on duties given to the appellee and her husband, and the status of their engagement in work<br/>
(a) On weekdays (from Monday to Friday)<br/>
(A) The Company instructed the appellee and her husband to perform the following duties during the scheduled working hours: (i) deal with visitors, etc. at the caretaker's office; (ii) confirm the number of containers which contain goods to be delivered to the stores on the first floor of the building; (iii) inspect whether or not there is any problem with the tap water; (iv) go on patrol inside and outside of the building; (v) keep the bicycle parking space in order; (vi) manage recyclable trash; (vii) respond to the applications (requests) for parking cars from constructors or other visitors; (viii) receive parcels, etc. and deliver them to residents; (ix) report their work (including preparation of a daily caretaker's report and management service report).<br/>
(B) The Company instructed the appellee and her husband to perform the following duties during the hours before 9:00 a.m. and after 6:00 p.m. on weekdays: (i) turn on the light of the caretaker's office (at 7:00 a.m.); (ii) unlock the door of the trash depository (at 7:00 a.m.); (iii) turn on the air-conditioners for the Leased Space (at 8:30 a.m.); (iv) turn off the air-conditioners for the Leased Space (at 8:00 p.m.); (v) check and deal with any unauthorized parked cars (at 9:00 p.m.); (vi) lock the door of the trash depository (at 9:00 p.m.); (vii) turn off the light of the caretaker's office (at 10:00 p.m.) (these duties and the duties mentioned in (A) above are hereinafter collectively referred to as "duties under instruction"; the duties (B)(iii) and (iv) were required to be performed only during the period from June to September (for cooling) and during the period from December to March (for heating)).<br/>
The Company's Manual stated that the appellee and her husband should also respond to requests from residents or visitors for receipt and delivery of parcels, etc. at any time even outside the prescribed working hours.<br/>
(C) According to the instructions described in (A) and (B), the appellee and her husband performed the duties under instruction. They often performed the duties mentioned in (A) not only within the scheduled working hours but also outside these hours.<br/>
The appellee and her husband stayed at the caretaker's office during the hours from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. Before and after these hours and on days off, they put up a "Closed" sign, closed the counter of the caretaker's office, and stayed in the room next to the caretaker's office, but they answered calls from residents over the intercom, and also received registered mails, parcels, etc. in the absence of residents and delivered them to residents.<br/>
(b) On Saturdays<br/>
(A) Since the performance of duties was also required on Saturdays under the Management Service Contract, the Company instructed the appellee and her husband to basically perform the same duties as those to be performed on weekdays. However, since Saturdays were designated as days off under the Company's rules of employment, the Company requested that on Saturdays, only either one of the appellee and her husband should perform the duties, while allowing the person who worked on Saturday to take a substitute day off on a weekday of the next week, and obtained consent from the appellee and her husband thereto. The duties on Saturdays required by the Company's instruction and the Company's Manual differed from those on weekdays in that: (i) since only one person was required to work on Saturdays, when the one on duty was out of the caretaker's office for patrol or other reasons, the other one was not required to stay at the caretaker's office; (ii) the air-conditioners should be turned off at 6:00 p.m.<br/>
(B) However, due to the nature of the duties on Saturdays, which was not so different from that of the duties on weekdays, and the demand from residents, the appellee and her husband worked on Saturdays almost in the same manner as on weekdays.<br/>
(c) On Sundays and national holidays<br/>
(A) Since Sundays and national holidays were designated as days off for the appellee and her husband, the Company did not instruct them to perform duties mentioned in (a)(B), except for the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office and locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, and applied the same instruction on other days off. The Company instructed the appellee and her husband to take a substitute day off for working on Sunday or a national holiday for unavoidable reasons.<br/>
(B) However, due to the nature of the duties on Sundays and national holidays, which was not so different from that of the duties on weekdays, and the demand from residents, the appellee and her husband were also engaged in reception duties such as dealing with requests from residents, receipt of parcels, etc. and delivery of them to residents, giving instructions on parking cars, keeping the bicycle parking space in order, and managing recyclable trash also on Sundays and national holidays. However, on Sundays and national holidays, they were required to perform the reception duty far less frequently than on weekdays and Saturdays.<br/>
(d) Other instructions on duties<br/>
The Company requested that the appellee and her husband should cooperate in performing the caretaker's duties, while leaving it to their discussion to decide which one of them should perform each duty.<br/>
Also as instructed by the Company, the appellee and her husband prepared a daily caretaker's report every day and submitted it to the Company. By way of the daily caretaker's reports and other reports, the Company received periodical reports on duties from the appellee and her husband, and gave instructions on their duties as needed.<br/><br/>
3. According to the facts mentioned above, the court of second instance partially upheld the appellee's claim, while dismissing the remaining part of the claim, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) On weekdays, Saturdays, Sundays and national holidays, the appellee and her husband started to perform the duties under instruction at 7:00 a.m. (turning on the light of the caretaker's office and unlocking the door of the trash depository), and ended performing the duties under instruction at 10:00 p.m. (turning off the light of the caretaker's office).<br/>
On weekdays and Saturdays, the appellee and her husband were engaged in the duties under instruction together, and they did not take any substitute days off. It is appropriate to construe that the duty of receiving parcels, etc. and delivering them to residents outside the scheduled working hours is also included in the scope of their prescribed duties. Although each duty under instruction was discrete and took only a short time to perform, since the appellee and her husband were required to provide services as requested by residents or visitors at any time also during the hours outside the scheduled working hours, they should be regarded as having been in effect ordered to stand ready until they start to perform the next duty, and therefore, it is appropriate to construe that the appellee and her husband were under the Company's control even during such hours.<br/>
Consequently, it is appropriate to construe that the appellee and her husband were engaged in overtime work during the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 9:00 a.m. and from 6:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. on weekdays and the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. on Saturdays.<br/>
(2) On the other hand, it is found that on Sundays and national holidays, the appellee and her husband were required to perform the reception duty far less frequently than on weekdays and Saturdays, and they were not particularly instructed to perform the duty of managing recyclable trash on these days. Under the Employment Contract and the Management Service Contract, Sundays and national holidays were designated as days off for the appellee and her husband, and it seems that the residents did not expect them to perform their duties on Sundays and national holidays in the same manner as on weekdays and Saturdays. In addition, considering the facts that the duties performed by the appellee and her husband could be performed only by a single person, and that the Company did not require them to perform their duties on Sundays and national holidays, except for the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office and locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, we can find it possible for at least either one of the appellee and her husband to get away from their duties and spend time freely.<br/>
Consequently, it is appropriate to construe that either one of the appellee and her husband was engaged in work on days off or overtime work during the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. on Sundays and national holidays.<br/>
(3) It is necessarily assumable from the nature of their duties that either one of the appellee and her husband who worked as live-in caretakers may spend some time during the scheduled working hours for their daily activities (e.g. going for shopping for daily commodities, etc.), and if such time spent for daily activities is not so long, it is justifiable to consider that they were under the Company's control even during the time spent for their daily activities. Since going to the hospital and taking a dog for a walk can be deemed to be included in the scope of daily activities of the appellee and her husband, it is inappropriate to construe that these activities were conducted away from the Company's control.<br/>
Consequently, even where the appellee and her husband spent some time in going to the hospital or taking a dog for a walk, it is not necessary to take into consideration the time spent for these activities when calculating the number of working hours for which extra allowances shall be paid.<br/><br/>
4. Of the holdings of the court of second instance mentioned above, the part concerning the overtime work on weekdays mentioned in 3(1) can be affirmed, whereas the remaining part cannot be affirmed, for the following reasons.<br/>
(1) "Working hours" set forth in Article 32 of the Labor Standards Act (hereinafter referred to as "working hours for the purpose of the Labor Standards Act") mean such hours during which a worker is under the employer's control, and it should be considered that whether or not such hours during which a worker is not actually engaged in work (hereinafter referred to as "non-working hours") fall within the scope of working hours for the purpose of the Labor Standards Act can be determined objectively depending on whether or not the worker can be deemed to be under the employer's control during such non-working hours (See 1995 (O) No. 2029, judgment of the First Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of March 9, 2000, Minshu Vol. 54, No. 3, at 801). The worker cannot be deemed to be away from the employer's control during non-working hours only because he/she is not actually engaged in work during these hours; the worker can only be deemed to not be under the employer's control where liberation from work is guaranteed for the worker during the non-working hours. Therefore, non-working hours should be deemed to also fall within the scope of working hours for the purpose of the Labor Standards Act if liberation from work is not guaranteed during such hours. Where a worker is deemed to be required to provide services under a labor contract even during such hours, we cannot say that liberation from work is guaranteed for the worker, and therefore it is appropriate to construe that the worker is under the employer's control (See 1997 (O) No. 608 and No. 609, judgment of the First Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of February 28, 2002, Minshu Vol. 56, No. 2, at 361).<br/>
(2) Concerning the overtime work on weekdays<br/>
(a) According to the facts mentioned above, the Company instructed the appellee and her husband to intermittently perform certain duties also outside the scheduled working hours, such as turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office, locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, and turning on and off the air-conditioners for the Leased Space, and the appellee and her husband, as instructed by the Company, performed these duties under instruction. As well, the Company instructed the appellee and her husband to leave the light on in the caretaker's office during the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., and the Company's Manual also stated that the appellee and her husband should also respond to requests from residents or visitors including ones for acceptance and delivery of parcels, etc. at any time even outside the scheduled working hours. In light of these facts, we should conclude that for the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., the residents expected to receive services from the caretakers, and the appellee and her husband were in effect placed in the situation that they should stand ready to respond to requests from residents, etc. at any time. Furthermore, considering that the Company received periodical reports on duties from the appellee and her husband by way of daily caretaker's reports and gave them instructions on their duties as needed, we should inevitably say that the Company recognized the fact that the appellee and her husband actually responded to requests from residents, etc. also outside the scheduled working hours. Taking into consideration all these circumstances, we should say that the Company gave the appellee and her husband implicit instructions on how to respond to requests from residents, etc.<br/>
Assuming so, we should conclude that the appellee and her husband were under the Company's control during the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. on weekdays (excluding the rest hour from noon until 1:00 p.m.), including the non-working hours during which they stayed in the room next to the caretaker's office, and these hours fall within the scope of working hours for the purpose of the Labor Standards Act. Consequently, we can affirm this part of the determination of the court of second instance as justifiable in that the court concluded that the appellee and her husband were engaged in overtime work during the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 9:00 a.m. and from 6:00 p.m. until 10:00 p.m. on weekdays.<br/>
(b) Also according to the facts mentioned above, unlike the instruction on work on Saturdays described later, the Company did not give such instruction that only one person should be engaged in work on weekdays, and the appellee and her husband were actually engaged in the duties under instruction together within and outside the scheduled working hours. Therefore, we can also affirm the determination of the court of second instance concluding that the appellee and her husband were engaged in overtime work together.<br/>
(c) In addition, the court of second instance determined that with regard to the days on which the light was turned off past 10:00 p.m., the hours until the time when the light was actually turned off also fall within the scope of working hours. We do not deny the acceptability of such determination by construing that it is based on the fact found by the court that the appellee and her husband continued to be engaged in work after 10:00 p.m. until the time when the light was turned off.<br/>
(d) The appeal counsels' argument on the points concerning the overtime work on weekdays mentioned above cannot be accepted.<br/>
(3) Concerning the overtime work on Saturdays<br/>
(a) The hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. on Saturdays (excluding the rest hour from noon until 1:00 p.m.), including the non-working hours during which the appellee and her husband stayed in the room next to the caretaker's office should be deemed to fall within the scope of working hours for the purpose of the Labor Standards Act, as in case of weekdays.<br/>
According to the facts found by the court of second instance, the Company requested that on Saturdays, only either one of the appellee and her husband should perform the duties, while allowing the person who worked on Saturday to take a substitute day off on a weekday of the next week, and obtained consent from the appellee and her husband thereto. On the other hand, however, the appellee and her husband actually never took a substitute day off on a weekday of the next week. Therefore, the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. on Saturdays (excluding the rest hour from noon until 1:00 p.m.) should be deemed to all fall within the scope of hours spent for overtime work.<br/>
(b) However, as noted above, the Company requested that on Saturdays, only either one of the appellee and her husband should perform the duties, while allowing the person who worked on Saturday to take a substitute day off on a weekday of the next week, and obtained consent from the appellee and her husband thereto. Also according to the facts mentioned above, the Company gave instruction to the appellee and her husband to the effect that since only one person was required to work on Saturdays, when the one on duty was out of the caretaker's office for patrol or other reasons, the other one was not required to stay at the caretaker's office. Furthermore, according to the facts mentioned above, it was basically possible for a single person to perform the caretaker's duties because the caretaker was actually engaged in work only for limited hours and the caretaker's duties were easy to perform.<br/>
As explained above, since the Company gave clear instruction to the appellee and her husband that only one of them should be engaged in work on Saturdays, and they consented to this instruction, and the volume of duties on Saturdays cannot be deemed to be too large to be handled by a single person, it is appropriate to calculate the number of working hours on Saturdays by deeming, in light of the content of the instruction, the status of performance of duties and volume of duties, that only either one of the appellee and her husband was engaged in performing their duties.<br/>
(4) Work on days off or overtime work on Sundays and national holidays<br/>
According to the facts mentioned above, on Sundays and national holidays, which were designated as days off under the Employment Contract, the Company did not instruct the appellee and her husband to perform their duties, except for the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office and locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository. Sundays and national holidays were also designated as days off under the Management Service Contract.<br/>
Therefore, we can construe that on Sundays and national holidays, the appellee and her husband were not required to provide labor services except for the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office and locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, which means that liberation from labor was guaranteed for them, and they cannot be regarded as having been in effect ordered to stand ready for work during the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m. on Sundays and national holidays. Consequently, we cannot construe that all these hours fall within the scope of working hours for the purpose of the Labor Standards Act, and we should conclude that on Sundays and national holidays, the appellee and her husband were engaged in work on days off or overtime work only for the hours during which they were actually engaged in performing the duties that the Company explicitly or implicitly instructed them to perform, including the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office and locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository.<br/>
(5) Hours spent for going to the hospital or taking a dog for a walk<br/>
If the appellee and her husband spent any time in going to the hospital or taking a dog for a walk, these activities were their private activities that were not related to the caretaker's duties and therefore cannot be deemed to be necessarily incidental to the performance of the caretaker's duties, even where we take into consideration the fact that they worked as live-in caretakers. Therefore, we cannot construe that the appellee and her husband were under the Company's control during the hours that they spent in going to the hospital or taking a dog for a walk.<br/><br/>
5. For the reasons stated above, we cannot affirm part of the determination of the court of second instance in that: (i) the court concluded that on Saturdays, both the appellee and her husband were engaged in overtime work; (ii) the court concluded that on Sundays and national holidays, either one of the appellee and her husband was engaged in work on days off or overtime work during the hours from 7:00 a.m. until 10:00 p.m., without examining how much time was spent for works they were actually engaged; (iii) and the court concluded that the appellee and her husband were under the Company's control also during the time that they spent in going to the hospital or taking a dog for a walk. With respect to these points, the determination of the court of second instance contains a violation of laws or regulations that apparently affects its judgment. The appeal counsels' argument is well-grounded to the extent that they allege such violation. In relation to point (iii), it is necessary to calculate the number of hours on weekdays during which the appellee and her husband were engaged in overtime work, by deducting the hours spent for going to the hospital or taking a dog for a walk. Therefore, after all, the part of the judgment of prior instance for which the appellant lost the case should inevitably be quashed in whole. For further examination as required, we remand this case to the court of prior instance.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

Reasons:
Concerning the reasons for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsels, MASUOKA Yoshihiro and AOTA Yo<br/>
1. Under the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (prior to the revision by Act No. 43 of 2004; hereinafter referred to as the "Act"), transactions on a commodity market may only be carried out by a member of a commodity exchange that opens said market (hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange") (Article 77 of the Act). Therefore, if a person other than a member intends to carry out such a transaction, he/she should consign a transaction to a member of the Exchange. Members who may accept such consignment are limited to futures commission merchants who have received a license from the competent minister (Article 126 of the Act).<br/>
Article 97-2 of the Act provides that a member shall, for its business of accepting consignment (meaning the business of accepting consignment of transactions on a commodity market; the same applies hereinafter), deposit with the Exchange security money for acceptance of consignment for the interest of each customer, and that the amount of security money for acceptance of consignment shall be the total of the amount prescribed in para.2, item 1 of the said Article (hereinafter referred to as the "fixed portion") and the amount prescribed in item 2 of the said paragraph (hereinafter referred to as the "floating portion"). Article 97-3, para.1 of the Act provides that "A person who has consigned a transaction on a commodity market to a member may, in order to receive payment for the claims arising from such consignment, make a claim to the Exchange for payment of security money for acceptance of consignment pertaining to the member."<br/>
Article 97-2, para.3 of the Act provides that where a member has concluded a contract with a person designated by the competent minister (hereinafter referred to as a "designated payment organization") in which the designated payment organization promises to make payment, on behalf of the member, the debt within the limit of the contracted amount (hereinafter referred to as the "contracted amount of payment") to the person who has consigned the transaction to the member, if the member is unable to pay debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment of a transaction on the commodity market (such contract shall hereinafter be referred to as a "payment contract"), the amount of security money for acceptance of consignment shall be the total of the fixed portion and the floating portion after deducting therefrom the contracted amount of payment. Article 97-11, para.3 of the Act provides that "A person who has consigned a transaction on a commodity market to a futures commission merchant who has concluded a payment contract with a designated payment organization may, when the futures commission merchant is unable to pay debt pertaining to acceptance of such consignment, make a claim to the designated payment organization for payment of the contracted amount of payment."<br/>
In this case, the appellee of final appeal who consigned a commodity futures transaction to A, a member of the appellant of final appeal, Tokyo Grain Commodity Exchange (hereinafter referred to as the "Appellant Exchange"), argues that the claim for damages for A's default of the consignment contract or tort that the appellee alleges to have acquired vis-a-vis A (this claim is hereinafter referred to as the "Claim," and A's debt corresponding to the Claim is hereinafter referred to as the "Debt") falls, vis-a-vis Appellant Exchange, within the scope of "claims arising from [such] consignment" set forth in Article 97-3, para.1 of the Act (when used without any modifier, the phrase "claims arising from consignment" refers hereinafter to one set forth in the said paragraph), and falls, vis-a-vis the other appellant of final appeal, National Futures Protection Fund (hereinafter referred to as "Appellant Fund"), within the scope of "debt pertaining to acceptance of [such] consignment" set forth in Article 97-11, para.3 of the Act (when used without any modifier, the phrase "debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment" refers hereinafter to one set forth in the said paragraph). Based on this argument, the appellee requests the appellants to perform the obligations under these provisions.<br/><br/>
2. The outline of the facts determined by the court of second instance is as follows.<br/>
(1) Appellant Exchange is a juridical person founded mainly for the purpose of opening markets necessary for carrying out futures transactions of agricultural products and other commodities. A was a member of Appellant Exchange and licensed as a futures commission merchant, but was declared bankrupt on December 5, 2002. Appellant Fund is a juridical person founded for the purpose of providing customer protection services. On May 1, 2005, Appellant Fund took over the business, etc. of the Association of Compensation Funds for Consigned Liabilities in Commodity Futures, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as the "Fund Association"). The Fund Association is a juridical person that has the same purpose as Appellant Fund. This suit was initially filed against the Fund Association, and then in the second instance, Appellant Fund succeeded to the status held by the Fund Association in this suit upon taking over its business.<br/>
(2) Based on the consignment from the appellee, A carried out commodity futures transactions at Appellant Exchange during the period from March 28 to May 13, 2002 (these transactions are hereinafter referred to as the "Transactions"). The amount of deposit of a customer margin for the Transactions is 2,800,000 yen, and the amount of net loss arising from the Transactions is 1,766,395 yen. Prior to carrying out the Transactions, A had concluded a payment contract with the Fund Association, a designated payment organization.<br/>
(3) The appellee, alleging that he/she suffered damage from the illegal acts committed by A's employee in relation to the acceptance of consignment for the Transactions, filed a suit with the Osaka District Court against A to seek payment of 3,080,000 yen in total by reason of A's default of the consignment contract or tort (1,033,605 yen as the amount equivalent to the outstanding amount of customer margin, 1,766,395 yen as the amount of loss from the Transactions, and 280,000 yen as attorney's fees) (this suit shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Related Suit").<br/>
(4) In the Related Suit, on December 26, 2002, the Osaka District Court rendered a judgment to uphold the appellee's claims in whole by deeming that A admitted all of the facts from which the appellee's claims has arisen, since A failed to appear at court on the date for oral argument or submit a written answer or other necessary documents. This judgment became final and binding.<br/>
(5) The appellee submitted to Appellant Exchange a "written confirmation of the amount of the customer's claim" dated January 7, 2003, which indicates the "amount claimed" as 3,080,000 yen, the total of the outstanding amount of customer margin of 1,033,605 yen and the amount of damages of 2,046,395 yen, and also submitted to Appellant Exchange and the Fund Association a "written confirmation of the customer's claim" dated June 12, 2003, which indicates the amount of "deposited customer margin, etc." as 3,080,000 yen. However, Appellant Exchange and the Fund Association determined both the amount of "claims arising from consignment" and the amount of "debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment" to be 1,033,605 yen, which is equivalent to the outstanding amount of customer margin. On June 19, Appellant Exchange and the Fund Association paid the said amounts to the appellee, while refusing to pay the Claim, the amount of which is 2,046,395 yen, the total of the amount of loss from the Transactions (1,766,395 yen) and the amount of attorney's fees (280,000 yen), on the grounds that the Claim did not fall within the scope of "claims arising from consignment" or "debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment."<br/><br/>
3. According to the facts mentioned above, the court of second instance upheld the appellee's claims for payment of the Claim, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) The system of security money for acceptance of consignment was created by following and expanding the system of brokerage deposits set forth in Article 47 of the Commodity Exchange Act (prior to the revision by Act No. 97 of 1967). Para.3 of said Article provided that a person who has entrusted a commodity broker with buying and selling transactions on a commodity market may have his/her claims arising from the consignment paid prior to other obligees out of the commodity broker's brokerage deposits. The phrase "claims arising from consignment" set forth in this provision, considering that there was no provision in the said Act to restrict the contents and scope thereof and that commodity brokers were to bear brokerage deposits, can be construed to include a claim for damages for the broker's default of a consignment contract or tort, as long as there is a considerable causal relation between the said claim and the consignment. In the subsequent legislative process through which the customer protection system was enhanced, no provision was added to the Act to restrict the contents or scope of "claims arising from consignment," and in the system of security money for acceptance of consignment, the same phrase "claims arising from consignment" as used in the system of brokerage deposits is used. Therefore, the scope of "claims arising from consignment" should be deemed to include a claim for damages, and the phrase "debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment" should be construed to have the same contents as "claims arising from consignment."<br/>
(2) The Claim is a claim for damages. Since the appellee intended to exercise a claim for damages because of the impossibility of receiving a refund of part of the customer margin for the Transactions that A appropriated to cover the amount of loss, and attorney's fees should be regarded as an ancillary expense for the exercise of the claim, the Claim has a considerable causal relation with the consignment of the Transaction. Consequently, the Claim falls within the scope of "claims arising from consignment," and the Debt falls within the scope of "debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment."<br/><br/>
4. However, the determination of the court of second instance mentioned above cannot be affirmed, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) A futures commission merchant who engages in the business of accepting consignment is a commission agent under the Commercial Code to whom the legal provisions on mandates shall apply mutatis mutandis in terms of his/her relationship with the customer (Article 552, para.2 of the Commercial Code), which means that a futures commission merchant (mandatary) shall deliver to the customer (mandator) monies and other things that he/she has received during the course of administering the business of accepting consignment, and shall transfer, to the customer, rights he/she has acquired in his/her own name on behalf of the customer (Article 646 of the Civil Code). Consequently, a futures commission merchant is obliged to deliver to the customer any money, securities or other articles which have been deposited by the customer in association with transactions on a commodity market as well as any money, securities or other articles in the customer's account (hereinafter referred to as the "customer assets"), and we should therefore conclude that the customer's claim to seek, from the futures commission merchant, delivery of property recognized as the customer assets under the Commercial Code and other legal provisions (including a claim for interest and delay damages pertaining to such claim; hereinafter referred to as "claims for delivery of the customer assets"), obviously falls within the scope of "claims arising from consignment."<br/>
(2) The appellee argues that a claim for damages for the default of the consignment contract or tort which has a considerable causal relation with the business of accepting consignment also falls within the scope of "claims arising from consignment." Article 97-3, para.1 of the Act allows the customer to make a claim directly to the Exchange for payment of the security money for acceptance of consignment pertaining to the member concerned. As mentioned above, security money for acceptance of consignment consists of a fixed portion and a floating portion. In light of the provisions of the Act and the Ordinance for Security Money for Acceptance of Consignment (prior to the repeal by the Ordinance of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry No. 3 of 2005), the fluid portion forms a large part of security money for acceptance of consignment, and it corresponds to the amount of customer margin deposited by the customer to the member. The system for requiring a member to deposit security money for acceptance of consignment to the Exchange can be construed to be intended to have the customer margin, which forms part of the customer's assets, separately taken in the custody of the Exchange, thereby preserving the customer margin deposited by the customer. Furthermore, Article 136-15 of the Act provides that with regard to any property equivalent to the value of customer assets, a futures commission merchant shall, for the purpose of securing payment of debt arising from the business of accepting consignment, deposit such property with a financial institution separately from the other property of the futures commission merchant or take any other necessary measures, in order to preserve such property. The floating portion of security money for acceptance of consignment is excluded from the scope of property under segregation because it is separately deposited with the Exchange (Article 41, para.1, item 7 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Commodity Exchange Act (prior to the overall revision by the Ordinance of the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries and Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry No. 3 of 2005; hereinafter referred to as the "Ordinance for Enforcement of the Act")). Also from this, it is obvious that a deposit of security money for acceptance of consignment is intended to preserve the customer margin, which forms part of the customer assets. It follows that payment by the Exchange of security money for acceptance of consignment has the essence of payment of the customer margin, which forms part of the customer assets.<br/>
In light of the facts that the Exchange may pay security money for acceptance of consignment only up to the amount of security money for acceptance of consignment pertaining to the member concerned, and such payment has the essence of payment of the customer margin deposited by the customer, it is appropriate to construe that the phrase "claims arising from consignment" refers to a claim for delivery of the customer assets. The customer's claim for damages for the member's default or tort, even if it has a considerable causal relation with the member's business of accepting consignment, cannot be deemed to form part of the customer assets. If such claim for damages were included in the scope of "claims arising from consignment" and were to be paid out of security money for acceptance of consignment, it could victimize claims for delivery of the customer margin held by other customers who have also consigned transactions on the commodity market to the same member, which would go contrary to the purpose of the system of security money for acceptance of consignment, i.e. preservation of customer margins. Consequently, such claim for damages should be construed to be excluded from the scope of "claims arising from consignment."<br/>
In addition to the above, Article 136-22 of the Act requires a futures commission merchant to set aside a liability reserve for commodity trading according to the transaction volume of futures transactions, and also provides that a liability reserve for commodity trading shall not be used other than in a case of compensating losses caused by an accident that has occurred in relation to an acceptance of a consignment of futures transactions, etc. which is specified by an ordinance of the competent ministry. The fact that the Act separately provides for the system of setting aside liability reserves for commodity trading out of futures commission merchants' own funds for the purpose of compensating losses caused by accidents that have occurred in relation to the acceptance of consignment of futures transactions, can be construed to support the conclusion that the claim for damages does not fall within the scope of claims to be covered by payment of security money for acceptance of consignment, which has the essence of payment of the customer margin.<br/>
(3) Article 97-11, para.3 of the Act provides for payment by a designated payment organization in the case where a futures commission merchant is unable to pay debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment. The phrase "debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment" set forth in this paragraph is one that is used to describe what is referred to by the phrase "claims arising from consignment" in Article 97-3, para.1 from the standpoint of a futures commission merchant who has accepted the consignment, and they have the same scope of substance as two sides of the same coin. The contracted amount of payment to be paid by a designated payment organization directly to the customer under Article 97-11, para.3 of the Act is half of the floating portion (Article 97-12, para.2 of the Act, Article 17 of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Act, Article 11 of the Fund Association's Regulations for Payment-Related Operations), which corresponds to half of the amount of customer margin. Since the amount of security money for acceptance of consignment to be deposited by a member with the Exchange is calculated by deducting the contracted amount of payment from the amount of customer margin, payment of the contracted amount of payment has, in combination with payment of security money for acceptance of consignment by the Exchange, the essence of delivery of the customer margin to the customer. Consequently, it is appropriate to construe that the customer's claim to seek payment from a designated payment organization under Article 97-11, para.3 of the Act should also be regarded as a claim for delivery of the customer assets, and it cannot include a claim for damages for a default or tort.<br/>
(4) In addition to payment of the contracted amount of payment, a designated payment organization makes payment under a voluntary payment contract or segregation payment contract to a customer of a member who has concluded such contracts. Payment under these contracts is also made within the limit of the amount of customer assets (Article 11 and Article 11-2 of the Fund Association's Regulations of Payment Operations), and in combination with payment of security money for acceptance of consignment and payment of the contracted amount of payment, it has the essence of delivery of the customer assets to the customer. If payment should also be made for a claim for damages for a default or tort, it could victimize claims for delivery of the customer assets held by another customer who has also consigned transactions on the commodity market to the same futures commission merchant, which would go contrary to the purpose of the system of payment by designated payment organizations.<br/>
(5) Consequently, it is appropriate to construe that the claim based on which a customer may seek payment of security money for acceptance of consignment from the Exchange as well as payment from a designated payment organization is, after all, a claim for delivery of the customer assets, and it does not include a claim for damages for a default or tort.<br/>
(6) However, a customer has a claim for delivery of any property that should be recognized as the customer assets, even where such property is not indicated in the futures commission merchant's books or documents. Therefore, even when a customer makes a claim with the Exchange or the designated payment organization for what he/she referred to as damages to compensate losses, if this claim is one that should basically be recognized as a claim for delivery of the customer assets, the customer may be deemed in effect to seek satisfaction of his/her claim for delivery of the customer assets, and the Exchange and the designated payment organization should make payment for such claim for the purpose of preserving and restoring the customer assets.<br/>
(7) It is obvious that part of the Claim which is to seek payment of 280,000 yen as attorney's fees does not have the essence of a claim for delivery of the customer assets, and therefore we should conclude that the appellee's claims against the appellants for attorney's fees are groundless. On the other hand, the substance of another part of the Claim which is to seek 1,766,395 yen as the amount of loss from the Transaction is not sufficiently clear, and depending on the substance of the loss incurred by the appellee, there is the possibility that this part of the Claim can be regarded as having the essence of a claim for delivery of the customer assets.<br/><br/>
5. The court of prior instance, without examining whether or not the Claim has the essence of a claim for delivery of customer assets, upheld the appellee's claims for payment of the Claim based on the view that a claim for damages falls within the scope of "claims arising from consignment" (the same applies to "debt pertaining to acceptance of consignment"). Such determination contains a violation of laws and regulations that obviously affects the judgment. The appellant's argument is well-grounded in that it alleges such violation, and the judgment of prior instance should inevitably be quashed. We dismiss the appellee's claims to seek from the appellants 280,000 yen as attorney's fees with delay damages thereon as groundless. For further examination as to whether or not the claim for payment of 1,766,395 yen as the amount of loss from the Transactions with delay damages thereon has the essence of a claim for delivery of customer assets, this case is remanded to the court of prior instance.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

    <Abstract>Given the facts that a number of money loans were provided over many years, without concluding a basic contract, by the same lender to the same borrower repeatedly and continuously, except for one of them, for the purpose of replacing the previous loans and providing additional loans, and that even said exceptional loan was close in time to the immediately preceding repayment and was provided by the same method and under the same terms as those for the previous and subsequent loans, and therefore all these loans should be deemed to be a single consecutive loan transaction, it is appropriate to construe that the contracts for money loans for consumption for these loans contain an implied agreement that if an overpayment occurs in the repayment of loan debts arising from these loans by paying interest at a rate exceeding the limit set by the Interest Rate Restriction Act, such overpayment would be appropriated to the repayment of any new loan debt that arises later.</Abstract>

The final appeal is dismissed.<br/>
The appellant of final appeal shall bear the cost of the final appeal.
Reasons:
Concerning Reason I for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsel, YAMADA Arihiro, et al.<br/>
1. The outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance is as follows:<br/>
(1) The appellant of final appeal is a moneylender engaged in moneylending business with registration under Article 3 of the Moneylending Control Act.<br/>
(2) The appellant, during the period from 1986 until April 5, 2004, provided loans to A and received repayments from A repeatedly. The status of the loans conducted between them on and after October 25, 1993 (hereinafter referred to as the "Loans") and repayments thereof are as indicated in Attachment 3 of the judgment of first instance. For the Loans, an agreement was made that repayment shall be made by the method of repaying the same amount of principal and interest every month in the designated number of installments (generally referred to as "equal monthly payments with interest"), at a rate that exceeds the upper limit of interest rate under Article 1, para.1 of the Interest Rate Restriction Act.<br/>
(3) All of the Loans, except for the loan provided on July 17, 2003, were provided for the purpose of refinancing in a manner that, prior to the agreed due date of repayment of the previous loan, an agreement was made to set the total of the outstanding amount of the previous loan and the amount of an additional loan as the amount of a new loan, and based on this agreement, the appellant was to provide A with the amount of money (additional loan) calculated by deducting the outstanding amount of the previous loan from the amount of the new loan, thereby deeming the outstanding amount of the previous loan to have been repaid in full. On the occasions of providing refinancing loans, a written application for loan, written contract, receipt and other relevant documents were prepared separately, and on each occasion, A visited the appellant's office and received additional loans calculated as above after going through the immediate documentary screening procedure. The appellant recommended refinancing to A when he/she had paid about six repayment installments as agreed.<br/>
(4) On April 2, 2003, A made payment to repay all debts arising from the loans provided so far, but on July 17, 2003, about three months later, a loan was provided under the same terms as those for the previous loans, and refinancing was provided under the same agreement as that for the previous loans on January 6, 2004. Subsequently, until April 5, 2003, A paid installments of principal and interest repeatedly.<br/>
(5) A was adjudicated to be bankrupt on July 28, 2004, and the appellee of final appeal was appointed as bankruptcy trustee.<br/><br/>
2. In this case, the appellee alleges that an overpayment can be found in the repayments made by A, before the declaration of bankruptcy, under the contracts for money loans for consumption concluded with the appellant, if the portion of the amount of paid interest exceeding the amount calculated at the upper limit of the interest rate prescribed in Article 1, para.1 of the Interest Rate Restriction Act (such portion shall hereinafter be referred to as the "interest in excess") were appropriated to the repayment of the principals, and based on this allegation, the appellee seeks, from the appellant, refund of the overpayment based on the right to claim refund of unjust enrichment.<br/>
The court of second instance determined as follows. The Loans constitute a single consecutive loan transaction for which appropriation of principal and interest should be calculated by regarding all of these loans as a series of transactions, and therefore if an overpayment occurs after appropriating the interest in excess paid by A to the repayment of the principals and then any debt arises from a new loan, it should be construed that such overpayment shall be appropriated to the repayment of the new loan debt. In conclusion, the court partially upheld the appellee's claim for refund of unjust enrichment from the appellant.<br/>
The appeal counsel alleges that this determination of the court of second instance regarding the appropriation of an overpayment violates laws and regulations.<br/><br/>
3. According to the above-mentioned facts, the Loans, except for the loan provided on July 17, 2003, were repeatedly and continuously provided by the same method over many years for the purpose of replacing the previous loans and providing additional loans, and even the loan provided on July 17, 2003 was close in time to the immediately preceding repayment and was provided by the same method and under the same terms as those for the previous and subsequent loans. Therefore, the court of second instance is appropriate in determining that the Loans should be deemed to be a single consecutive loan transaction.<br/>
In the case of a single consecutive loan transaction, as one formed by the Loans in this case, the parties, when providing or receiving a loan, anticipate that another loan will be provided so as to replace the former loan and provide additional loan, and they usually do not wish to give rise to more than one relationship of rights and obligations between them. In light of such intention of the parties, it is reasonable to construe that the parties have made an (implied) agreement that if an overpayment occurs after the interest in excess is appropriated to the repayment of the principals, such overpayment shall be appropriated to the repayment of any new loan debt that arises later.<br/>
Since the Loans constitute a single consecutive loan transaction as explained above, it is appropriate to construe that the contracts for money loans for consumption concluded between the appellant and A concerning the Loans contain an (implied) agreement that if an overpayment occurs in the repayment of loan debts arising from the Loans after appropriating the interest in excess to the repayment of the principals, such overpayment shall be appropriated to the repayment of any new loan debt that arises later.<br/><br/>
The determination of the court of second instance goes along with this reasoning and therefore can be affirmed. The appellant's argument cannot be accepted.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

    <Abstract>1. Where a moneylender, upon providing a loan under the agreement that repayment shall be made by equal monthly payments with interest, provided a borrower with a copy of a loan bond while believing that the copy can be regarded as a document required by Article 17, para.1 of the Moneylending Control Act, based on the facts of this case that (i) the copy of the loan bond indicates, in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section, the statement, "As indicated in the reimbursement schedule attached hereto," with a particular amount of principal and interest to be repaid, which means that it was intended that a reimbursement schedule constituted one and the same document together with the copy of the loan bond and that the amount of repayment for each installment shall be clarified by such integrated document, and (ii) the amount of repayment for the last installment indicated in the reimbursement schedule is inconsistent with the amount indicated in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section as the amount of principal and interest to be repaid, it cannot be deemed that a document stating the "amount of repayment" for each installment as required under Article 17, para.1 of the said Act has been provided, unless the reimbursement schedule is provided.<br/><br/>
2. Where a moneylender has received an amount of interest exceeding the upper limit under Article 1, para.1 of the Interest Rate Restriction Act, but Article 43, para.1 of the Moneylending Act shall not apply to such receipt, the moneylender shall be presumed to be a "beneficiary in bad faith" set forth in Article 704 of the Civil Code, unless the moneylender has believed that Article 43, para.1 of the said Act shall apply and has a special reason for asserting that it is unavoidable for the moneylender to have believed as such.</Abstract>

Reasons:
Concerning the reasons for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsel, TOYAMA Hidenori (except for those excluded)<br/>
1. The outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance is as follows.<br/>
(1) The appellee of final appeal is a moneylender registered under Article 3 of the Moneylending Control Act (hereinafter referred to as the "Moneylending Act").<br/>
(2) The appellee provided loans to the appellant of final appeal as follows at the respective interest rates indicated in (3) below and under the agreement that repayment shall be made by equal monthly payments with interest (each of these loans shall be numbered and referred to as "Loan 1" and so forth, and collectively referred to as the "Loans").<br/>
Loan 1: January 28, 1993; 100,000 yen<br/>
Loan 2: August 5, 1993; 150,000 yen<br/>
Loan 3: February 10, 1994; 200,000 yen<br/>
Loan 4: January 11, 1995; 200,000 yen<br/>
Loan 5: April 24, 1996; 300,000 yen<br/>
Loan 6: June 6, 1997; 320,000 yen<br/>
Loan 7: February 16, 1998; 320,000 yen<br/>
Loan 8: September 4, 1998; 300,000 yen<br/>
Loan 9: April 7, 2000; 200,000 yen<br/>
Loan 10: September 7, 2000; 300,000 yen<br/>
Loan 11: March 29, 2001; 300,000 yen<br/>
Loan 12: September 4, 2001; 350,000 yen<br/>
Loan 13: May 8, 2002; 150,000 yen<br/>
Loan 14: October 22, 2003; 200,000 yen<br/>
(3) The interest rate agreed on for the Loans was: 40.004% per annum (in proportion to the number of days on the basis of one year consisting of 365 days; hereinafter the same shall apply with regard to interest rates) for Loan 1 to Loan 5; 39.785% per annum for Loan 6 to Loan 9; 28.981% per annum for Loan 10 to Loan 14.<br/>
(4) Upon providing the Loans, the appellee provided the appellant with copies of the loan bonds entitled "Copies of Documents under Article 16, para.3 of the Ordinance" (hereinafter referred to as the "Contract Documents"). Each of the Contract Documents indicated, in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section, the statement, "As indicated in the reimbursement schedule attached hereto," with a particular amount of principal and interest to be repaid, and also contained a provision that any overpayment or underpayment shall be settled upon the last installment. The amount of repayment for the last installment indicated in the reimbursement schedule that the appellee alleges to have provided to the appellant and produces to the court as evidence was inconsistent with the amount of principal and interest to be repaid indicated in the said section of the Contract Document. Upon concluding contracts for Loan 12 to Loan 14, the appellee provided the appellant with reimbursement schedules.<br/>
(5) As repayments of debts arising from the Loans, the appellant made payments to the appellee as indicated in the "Amount of Payment" section of the account statement attached to the judgment of prior instance, on the dates indicated in the "Date" section of the said account statement (these payments shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Repayments").<br/>
(6) With regard to some of the Repayments, the contents of the documents provided by the appellee to the appellant, entitled "Receipt and Balance Report," do not satisfy the requirements under Article 18, para.1 of the Moneylending Act. However, the appellee believed that these documents also satisfied the requirements and therefore Article 43, para.1 of the said Act shall apply to them.<br/><br/>
2. In this case, the appellant alleges that an overpayment can be found in the repayments of the Loans as indicated in Attachment 1 of the judgment of first instance, if the portion of the amount of paid interest exceeding the amount calculated at the upper limit of the interest rate prescribed in Article 1, para.1 of the Interest Rate Restriction Act (such portion shall hereinafter be referred to as the "interest paid in excess") is appropriated to the payment of the principals, and also alleges that the appellee knew that there was not legal cause for its receipt of the overpayment. Based on this allegation, the appellant seeks, from the appellee, refund of the overpayment with interest thereon at the rate prescribed in the first sentence of Article 704 of the Civil Code, based on the right to claim return of unjust enrichment.<br/><br/>
3. The court of second instance held that the Contract Documents can be regarded as documents stating the matters required under Article 17, para.1 of the Moneylending Act (hereinafter referred to as "Article 17 Document"), and calculated the amount of overpayment on the premise that Article 43, para.1 of the said Act shall apply to the Repayments, except for those for which a document stating the matters required under Article 18, para.1 of the said Act was not provided. The court also held that the appellee cannot be deemed to be a beneficiary in bad faith for having received the overpayment until the complaint of this lawsuit was served to the appellee. The grounds for these holdings are as follows.<br/>
(1) Since each of the Contract Documents indicates, in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section, particular amount as the amount of principal and interest to be repaid, the Contract Documents for Loan 1 to Loan 11, irrespective of whether or not they are accompanied by reimbursement schedules, satisfy Article 17, para.1, item 9 of the Moneylending Act and the requirement of indicating the "amount of repayment" for each installment under Article 13, para.1, item 1(h) of the Ordinance for Enforcement of the Moneylending Act (hereinafter referred to as the "Enforcement Ordinance").<br/>
(2) The phrase "in bad faith" as used in Article 704 of the Civil Code means that a beneficiary recognizes that he/she is legally obliged to return unjust enrichment. A moneylender cannot be deemed to recognize such a legal obligation if the moneylender recognizes the possibility that Article 43, para.1 of the Moneylending Act could apply. A moneylender, although he/she engages in the business activity of making profits by providing loans at high interest rates, cannot be regarded as always knowing whether or not Article 43, para.1 of the said Act applies for each and every customer. This is also true for the appellee.<br/><br/>
4. However, the determination of the court of second instance mentioned above cannot be affirmed, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) Concerning the determination mentioned in 3(1) above<br/>
It can be construed that the purpose of Article 17, para.1 of the Moneylending Act, which provides that upon concluding a loan contract, a moneylender shall provide the borrower with an Article 17 Document, is to have the details of the agreements for the loan fixed in a document, thereby ensuring appropriate operation of moneylending business and preventing the possible occurrence of disputes between the parties over the details of the agreements for the loan. Therefore, where a document provided as a document indicating matters required under Article 17 of the Moneylending Act does not correctly or clearly state the matters required under Article 17, para.1 of the Moneylending Act, the requirement for applying Article 43, para.1 of the said Act should be deemed not to be satisfied (See 2003 (Ju) No. 1653, judgment of the Third Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of January 24, 2006, Minshu Vol. 60, No. 1, at 319).<br/>
An Article 17 Document shall indicate the "amount of repayment" for each installment (Article 17, para.1, item 9 of the Moneylending Act (Article 17, para.1, item 8 of the said Act prior to the revision by Act No. 112 of 2000) and Article 13, para.1, item 1(h) of the Enforcement Ordinance). In this case, however, according to the facts mentioned above, each of the Contract Documents indicates, in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section, the statement, "As indicated in the reimbursement schedule attached hereto," which means that it was intended that a reimbursement schedule constituted one and the same document together with the Contract Document and that the amount of repayment for each installment shall be clarified by such integrated document. Even where the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section indicates the amount of principal and interest payable for each installment, it is often the case that the amount of repayment for the last installment does not agree with the amount indicated in the said section, and such inconsistency is actually found in this case. Therefore, we should say that the amount of principal and interest indicated in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section cannot be deemed to indicate an accurate amount of repayment for each installment.<br/>
On the other hand, the court of second instance, without undergoing any fact-finding process as to whether or not a reimbursement schedule was provided with regard to Loan 1 to Loan 11, concluded that the delivery of the Contract Documents alone can be deemed to be the provision of an Article 17 Document. In this respect, the determination of the court of second instance mentioned in 3(1) above contains a violation of laws and regulations that obviously affects the judgment.<br/><br/>
(2) Concerning the determination mentioned in 3(2) above<br/>
For a money loan for consumption, a contract for interest at a rate that exceeds the upper limit of the interest rate provided in Article 1, para.1 of the Interest Rate Restriction Act (hereinafter simply referred to as the "upper limit of the interest rate") shall be void with respect to the part exceeding the upper limit. This rule also applies to moneylenders, and they are allowed to receive the interest paid in excess as a valid repayment of interest debt only if the requirements of Article 43, para.1 of the Moneylending Act are satisfied. In light of such purport of the relevant legal provisions, moneylenders should be deemed to fully recognize that where Article 43, para.1 of the said Act cannot apply, the interest paid in excess should be appropriated for the payment of the outstanding loan principal, if any, and an overpayment that occurs after the outstanding principal has been repaid in full should be refunded to the borrower as return of unjust enrichment. Consequently, where a moneylender has received the interest paid in excess as repayment of interest debt, but Article 43, para.1 of the Moneylending Act shall not apply to such receipt, the moneylender should be presumed to be a person who has obtained an overpayment knowing that there is no legal cause therefor, or a "beneficiary in bad faith" set forth in Article 704 of the Civil Code, unless the moneylender has believed that Article 43, para.1 of the said Act shall apply and has a special reason for asserting that it is unavoidable for the moneylender to have believed as such.<br/>
In this case, according to the facts mentioned above, the appellee, as a moneylender, provided the Loans to the appellant at agreed interest rates that exceeded the upper limit of the interest rate, and received the Repayments which contain the interest paid in excess. Since Article 43, para.1 of the Moneylending Act shall not apply to, at least, part of that interest paid in excess, the appellee should be presumed to be a beneficiary in bad faith for having obtained an overpayment, unless it has the special reason mentioned above.<br/>
The court of second instance, without making any determination as to whether or not the appellee has the aforementioned special reason, held that a moneylender cannot be deemed to be a beneficiary in bad faith if he/she recognizes the possibility that Article 43, para.1 of the Moneylending Act could apply, and concluded that with regard to the repayments to which Article 43, para.1 of the said Act shall not apply, the appellee cannot be deemed to be a beneficiary in bad faith until the date of service of the complaint of this lawsuit. In this respect, the determination of the court of second instance mentioned in 3(2) above contains a violation of laws and regulations that obviously affects the judgment.<br/><br/>
5. For the reasons stated above, the appeal counsel's arguments are well-grounded regarding the points mentioned above, and the judgment of prior instance should inevitably be quashed with respect to the part for which the appellant lost the case concerning the claim to seek return of unjust enrichment. For further examination as to whether or not reimbursement schedules were provided to the appellant and whether or not the appellee has the aforementioned special reason, this case is remanded to the court of prior instance with respect to the said part of the judgment.<br/><br/>
The appellant also made a claim to seek compensation for non-pecuniary damage from a tort of refusing to disclose the transaction records, but did not submit a document stating reasons for petition for acceptance of final appeal on this claim. Therefore, the final appeal concerning this claim is dismissed without prejudice.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

The judgment of prior instance is quashed, and the judgment of first instance is revoked.<br/>
The claim made by the appellee of final appeal is dismissed in whole.<br/>
The appellee of final appeal shall bear the whole cost of the lawsuit.
Reasons:
Concerning the reasons for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsel, SATO Masaaki<br/>
1. In this case, the appellee of final appeal, who purchased the land at an auction, requests the appellants of final appeal, the co-owners of the building standing on the said land, to remove the building and surrender the land. The parties dispute whether or not a statutory superficies shall be established for the benefit of the said building.<br/><br/>
2. The outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance is as follows.<br/>
(1) The land indicated in section 1 of the list of articles attached to the judgment of first instance (hereinafter referred to as the "Land") was owned by Appellant of Final Appeal Y1, and the building standing on the Land indicated in section 2 of the said list (hereinafter referred to as the "Building") was owned by A, respectively. On May 29, 1969, a joint revolving mortgage was established on the Land and the Building, designating A as the debtor and B as the mortgagee, and the establishment of the mortgage was registered on May 30 (this mortgage shall hereinafter be referred to as the "First Mortgage").<br/>
(2) A died on September 26, 1978, and Appellant Y1, who is A's wife, and other appellants of final appeal, who are A's children, succeeded to A and became the co-owners of the Building.<br/>
(3) On October 12, 1992, a revolving mortgage was established on the Land, designating C as the debtor and D as the mortgagee, and the establishment of the mortgage was registered on October 15 (this mortgage shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Second Mortgage").<br/>
(4) The contract for establishment of the First Mortgage was cancelled on October 30, 1992, and cancellation of the establishment of the revolving mortgage was registered on November 4, 1992.<br/>
(5) Subsequently, the Second Mortgage was exercised, and on July 2, 2004, the appellee purchased the Land at an auction and acquired ownership therein.<br/><br/>
3. The court of second instance denied the establishment of a statutory superficies on the Land and upheld the appellee's claim, holding as follows.<br/>
Where two mortgages were established on land, and the land and the building standing thereon belonged to different owners at the time of establishment of the first mortgage but came under the ownership of the same person by the time of establishment of the second mortgage, no statutory superficies shall be established if the first mortgage has been exercised and extinguished accordingly (1987 (O) No. 452, judgment of the Second Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of January 22, 1990, Minshu Vol. 44, No. 1, at 314). This reasoning should be construed to also be applicable where the contract for establishment of the first mortgage has been cancelled after the second mortgage was established. If a statutory superficies is established even in such a case, this would unjustly infringe the interest of the second mortgagee who estimated the margin of security of the land on the assumption that no burden of a statutory superficies exist on the land. On the other hand, if, in order to avoid such a situation, we require the second mortgagee to estimate the margin of security by taking into account the possibility that a statutory superficies may be established in the future, this would hinder full exploitation of the security's value. In addition, before cancellation of the contract for establishment of the first mortgage, the owner of the building was not eligible to argue the establishment of a statutory superficies due to the existence of the first mortgage. Thus, there is no need to grant any interest to the owner by recognizing a statutory superficies only because the contract for establishment of the first mortgage happened to be subsequently cancelled.<br/><br/>
4. However, the determination of the court of second instance mentioned above cannot be affirmed, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) Where two mortgages were established on the land, and the first mortgage has been extinguished as a result of the cancellation of the contract for establishment thereof, and then the land and the building standing thereon have come under the ownership of different persons as a result of the exercise of the second mortgage, even if the land and the building did not belong to the same owner at the time of establishment of the first mortgage, a statutory superficies shall be established if they belonged to the same owner at the time of establishment of the second mortgage. The reasons for this conclusion are as follows.<br/>
In the case mentioned in (1) above, we can presume that the second mortgagee, at the time of establishment of the mortgage, expected that no statutory superficies would be established if the mortgaged land was auctioned with the first mortgage still existing on the land (see the aforementioned judgment of the Second Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of January 22, 1990). However, since a mortgage is expected to continue to exist only as long as its very purpose, i.e. securing the claim, exists, it should be expected, from the nature of a mortgage, that the first mortgage might be extinguished as a result of the payment of the secured claim or the cancellation of the contract for establishment of the mortgage. Based on such expectation, the second mortgagee should have estimated the margin of security while taking into consideration the advantage of rising in rank in the order of priority and the disadvantage of tolerating the establishment of a statutory superficies in the event of extinguishment of the first mortgage. Consequently, even where the establishment of a statutory superficies is allowed as a result of the auction executed after the first mortgage has been extinguished, this cannot be deemed to cause unexpected damage to the second mortgagee. In such case, since the first mortgage has already been extinguished before the auction, it is obvious that there is no need to take into consideration the first mortgagee's interest when determining whether or not a statutory superficies is to be established as a result of the auction. This leads to the conclusion that there is no reason to determine whether or not the requirement that "land and a building on the land belong to the same owner" provided in Article 388 of the Civil Code (hereinafter referred to as the "same owner requirement") was satisfied retrospectively as of the time of establishment of the first mortgage.<br/>
Article 388 of the Civil Code provides that in cases where land and a building on the land belong to the same owner, if a mortgage is created with respect to that land or building, and the execution of that mortgage results in the creation of different owners, it shall be deemed that a superficies has been created with respect to that building. This provision can be construed to mean that in order to establish a statutory superficies, the same owner requirement must be satisfied not at the time of establishment of the first mortgage, which has already been extinguished before the auction, but at the time of establishment of the second mortgage, which is in the highest rank in the order of priority among the mortgages to be extinguished as a result of the auction. The judicial precedent cited by the judgment of prior instance, the judgment of the Second Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of January 22, 1990, points out that where more than one mortgage is to be extinguished as a result of the auction, the satisfaction of the same owner requirement should be determined as of the time of establishment of the mortgage in the highest rank among such mortgages. The mortgage that has already been extinguished before the auction cannot be treated in the same terms as the existing mortgage in the highest rank.<br/>
(2) In this case, the satisfaction of the same owner requirement should be determined as of the time of establishment of the Second Mortgage. Since at that time, Appellant Y1, one of the co-owners of the Building, owned the Land independently, the requirement for the establishment of a statutory superficies is satisfied (1971 (O) No. 844, judgment of the Third Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of December 21, 1971, Minshu Vol. 25, No. 9, at 1610). Consequently, we should conclude that a statutory superficies has been established for the benefit of the Building.<br/><br/>
5. The determination of the court of prior instance that contravenes this reasoning contains a violation of laws and regulations that apparently affects the judgment. The appellants' claim is well-grounded, and the judgment of prior instance should inevitably be quashed. According to the reasoning mentioned above, the appellee's claim is groundless, and therefore we revoke the judgment of first instance that upheld the appellee's claim and dismiss the said claim in whole.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

The final appeal is dismissed.<br/>
The appellant of final appeal shall bear the cost of the final appeal.
Reasons:
Concerning Reason IV for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsels, CHIBA Norio, ANDO Takehisa, and MORITA Kensuke<br/>
1. In this case, the appellee of final appeal, who is a member of the appellant of final appeal engaged in operating an accident compensation mutual-aid insurance program for small and medium-sized enterprises, seeks payment of compensation money from the appellant under the appellant's rules for accident compensation, for an accident wherein the insured person was suffocated by a rice cake that got stuck in his throat and suffered aftereffects due to hypoxic encephalopathy.<br/>
2. The outline of the facts legally determined by the court of the second instance is as follows:<br/>
(1) The appellant is an incorporated foundation engaged in operating an accident compensation mutual-aid insurance program for small and medium-sized enterprises.<br/>
On June 2, 1998, the appellee became a member of the appellant (then called by a different name), designating A (born in 1922), the husband of the appellee's representative person C, as the insured person.<br/>
(2) The appellant's rules (hereinafter referred to as the "Rules") provided for accident compensation as follows.<br/>
(a) (Beneficiary)<br/>
Where an accident has occurred with regard to the insured person designated by each member, the appellant shall pay compensation money to the member in accordance with the Rules.<br/>
(b) (Definition of accident)<br/>
The term "accident" under the Rules means a sudden and contingent event of external origin, in which the insured person has suffered a bodily injury.<br/>
(c) (Exemption from liability for compensation)<br/>
The appellant shall not pay compensation money for any injury caused by the insured person's disease, brain disorder, insanity, severe drunkenness, criminal act, combative act, suicidal act or gross negligence.<br/>
(3) In August 2003, A was diagnosed by a doctor as having Parkinson's disease. Although some patients suffering Parkinson's disease have a decline in swallowing function, A did not have any trouble in eating or drinking, and received no dietary instruction from the doctor.<br/>
(4) On February 3, 2005, A was suffocated by the rice cake that he/she ate for lunch (this shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Event"). Despite the resuscitative measures immediately taken at the hospital, the Event left a consciousness disorder in A due to hypoxic encephalopathy, and A finally fell into a state of requiring nursing care on a regular basis.<br/><br/>
3. The appellant argues that since the Event was caused by A's disease, A cannot be deemed to have suffered an injury in an event of external origin.<br/><br/>
4. The court of second instance upheld the appellee's claim, holding as follows.<br/>
(1) The person who claims compensation money under the Rules (hereinafter referred to as the "Claimant") is required to allege and prove that the insured person has suffered a bodily injury in an event of external origin but is not required to go so far as to allege and prove that there has been no internal cause of the event, such as the insured person's disease.<br/>
(2) In the Event, A was suffocated by the rice cake that got stuck in his throat, which was taken in from outside his body, and therefore A can be found to have suffered an injury in the Event which falls under the category of sudden and contingent event of external origin. There is no evidence showing that the Event was caused by A's disease.<br/><br/>
5. According to the facts mentioned above, the Rules provide that compensation money shall be paid when the insured person has suffered a bodily injury in a sudden and contingent event of external origin. From its literal meaning, the phrase "event of external origin" is construed to refer to an event caused by a force from outside the body of the insured person (hereinafter simply referred to as "outside force"). In addition to this provision, the Rules also provide that the appellant shall be exempted from the liability to pay compensation money for any injury caused by the insured person's disease.<br/>
In light of the above-mentioned language and structure of the Rules, we should conclude that the claimant is only required to allege and prove that there is a significant causal relation between the event caused by an outside force and the injury suffered by the insured person, and the claimant is not required to go so far as to allege and prove that the insured person's disease is not the cause of the injury suffered by the insured person.<br/>
In this case, according to the facts mentioned above, it is obvious that the Event was caused by a force outside A's body and that there is a significant causal relation between the Event and the injury, and therefore we should conclude that A suffered the injury in an event of external origin.<br/><br/>
6. For the reasons stated above, the determination of the court of second instance can be affirmed as justifiable, in that it found that the Event fell under the category of sudden and contingent event of external origin by employing the same reasoning as mentioned above. The appellant's argument cannot be accepted.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

    <FullText>Main text:
1. The judgment of prior instance is quashed with respect to the part concerning the claim made by the appellants of final appeal to seek damages for a tort.<br/>
2. This case is remanded to the Fukuoka High Court with respect to the part mentioned in the preceding paragraph.<br/>
3. The remaining part of the final appeal filed by the appellants of final appeal is dismissed.<br/>
4. The appellants of final appeal shall bear the cost of the final appeal with respect to the preceding paragraph.
Reasons:
Concerning Reason II-2 for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsel, KODA Masahiro<br/>
1. In this case, the appellants of final appeal, who purchased a building constructed as a nine-story condominium/store building from its original owner, allege that there are defects in the building including cracks and weakened bearing force of the reinforcing steel, and seek damages for a tort from an appellee of final appeal, Y1, who took charge of designing and construction supervision of the building. The appellants, while arguing that they have been acquired the status of oderer under the contract for work, also seek costs for repairing the defects or damages based on a warranty against defects as well as damages under the tort provision of the Civil Code from the other appellee of final appeal, Y2, who took charge of the construction of the building.<br/>
2. The outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance is as follows:<br/>
(1) Y1 is a company engaged in designing, planning and construction supervision of buildings. Y2 is a company engaged in civil engineering and building construction.<br/>
(2) On August 8, 1988, A purchased the land indicated in section 2 of the list of articles, Attachment 1 of the judgment of first instance (hereinafter referred to as the "Land"), and on October 19, 1988, concluded a contract for work with Y2 for constructing the building indicated in section 1 of the said attachment (hereinafter referred to as the "Building") at the price of 361 million yen (the contract price was later increased by 5.6 million yen) (this contract shall hereinafter referred to as the "Contract for Work").<br/>
(3) Y1 was entrusted by A with designing and construction supervision for the construction of the Building.<br/>
(4) The construction of the Building was completed on the last day of February 1990, and Y2 delivered the Building to A on March 2, 1990.<br/>
(5) On May 23, 1990, the appellants purchased from A the Land at 149,991,000 yen and the Building at 412,009,270 yen, and received delivery thereof. Between the appellants, the co-owner's share in the Land and the Building was determined as 75% for X1 and 25% for X2.<br/>
(6) The Building is a nine-story flat-roof reinforced concrete building constructed on the Land, which consists of a nine-story part (Part A) and a three-story part (Part B) connected with each other.<br/>
Part A has a parking lot on the first floor, and six residential units for rent on each of the second to ninth floors, with a bath, toilet, and kitchen installed in each unit. Each unit has a balcony on the south side, and leads to a common hallway on the north side. Elevators are installed on the west side of Part A. Part B has a store on the first floor, an office on the second floor, and two somewhat spacious residential units for rent on the third floor.<br/>
(7)The Building has the following defects:<br/>
(a) Part A: Cracks in the common hallway on the north side and in the balconies on the south side, which run parallel with the building<br/>
(b) Part A: Cracks in the common hallway on the north side and in the balconies on the south side, which run orthogonally with the building<br/>
(c) Part A: Cracks in the beams and walls of the parking lot on the first floor<br/>
(d) Part A: Cracks and deflection in the floor slabs of the residential units<br/>
(e) Part A: Cracks in the walls standing between the residential units<br/>
(f) Part A: Cracks in the exterior walls (the handrails of the hallway, and the exterior walls on the north and south sides)<br/>
(g) Part A: Exposure of the reinforcing steels of the eaves of the penthouse on the roof<br/>
(h) Part B: Cracks in the floors of the residential units<br/>
(i) Part B: Cracks in the interior walls of the residential units and in the exterior walls on the east and south sides<br/>
(j) Weakened bearing force of the reinforcing steel due to the cracks in the reinforced concrete<br/>
(k) Part B: Structural defects in the floor slabs (ceiling slabs) (the inclination of the cantilever beams and the shortage of reinforcing steel)<br/>
(l) Part B: Shortage of bearing force due to the piping sleeves penetrating the beams<br/>
(m) Part B: Exposure of the reinforcing steel of the floor slabs of the office on the second floor<br/>
(8) The appellants argue that in addition to the defects mentioned in (7), the Building has other defects such as wobbling of the handrails of the balconies and cracks and crevices in the pipes, and allege that the appellees shall be liable for a tort on the grounds that the Building has all these defects.<br/><br/>
3. The court of second instance dismissed the appellant's claim in whole, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) The appellants have not been assigned from A the contractual status to seek fulfillment of a warranty against defects from the appellees.<br/>
(2)(a) The existence of defects in a building does not necessarily raise a tort liability of the constructor or the person in charge of designing or construction supervision. There would be room to find a tort liability only where the defects are significantly illegal, for instance, where the constructor has produced a defective building with the positive intention of infringing the client's rights, where the nature of the defects is anti-social or unethical, or where the degree or substance of the defects in the building is so serious that the very existence of the building poses a danger to society.<br/>
(b) In order to find the appellees' tort liability, the aforementioned special requirements must be satisfied. However, the appellees cannot be found to have produced the defects with the positive intention of infringing the rights of the owner of the Building. The defects mentioned in 2(7), which are found by the court, are not so serious as to undermine the safety of the structural bearing force of the Building, and therefore the Building cannot be deemed to be unacceptably dangerous to the society or the public, nor can the nature of the defects be deemed to be anti-social or unethical. Furthermore, since other defects in the Building additionally alleged by the appellants usually cannot be regarded as being related to the foundation or structural framework of the Building, the tort liability would not be established even if such defects existed. Consequently, since the defects in the Building cannot be found to be significantly illegal to the extent to find a tort liability, without needing to make examination on other points, the appellants' claim based on the argument of a tort is groundless.<br/><br/>
4. However, the determination of the court of second instance mentioned in 3(2) above cannot be affirmed, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) Since a building is used by various people including those who live there, who work there and who visit there, and surrounded by other buildings or roads, a building must be safe enough to avoid endangering the life, body and property of the building users as well as neighbors and passers-by (hereinafter collectively referred to as "residents, etc."). Safety from this viewpoint should be regarded as the fundamental safety necessary for a building. Consequently, it is appropriate to construe that the persons involved in the construction of buildings, namely, the designer, constructor and construction supervisor (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "designer/constructor, etc.") shall, when constructing a building, bear the duty of care to secure the fundamental safety necessary for a building, not only to the party to the contract but also to residents, etc. who are not in a contractual relationship. If the negligence of this duty by the designer/constructor, etc. has resulted in defects in the building that undermine its fundamental safety, thereby infringing the life, body or property of residents, etc., the designer/constructor, etc. should be deemed to be liable under the tort provision of the Civil Code to pay damages caused by such defects, unless there are special circumstances where, for example, the person claiming the tort liability has purchased the building while knowing and taking into account the existence of the defects. This reasoning shall also apply where the residents, etc. have acquired the building from its original owner.<br/>
(2) The court of second instance held that the designer/constructor, etc. involved in the construction of a defective building should be held liable for a tort only where the defects in the building are significantly illegal, for instance, where the building has defects that are related to its foundation or structural framework and therefore the building is unacceptably dangerous to the society or the public, and based on this reasoning, the court concluded that the defects in the Building were not significantly illegal to the extent to find a tort liability. However, it should be construed that the liability for a tort shall be found where there are defects in a building that undermine the fundamental safety necessary for a building, and there is no reason to construe that the tort liability shall be established only where the defects are significantly illegal. For instance, a defect in the handrail of a balcony might endanger the life or body of residents, etc. because residents, etc. might fall down from the balcony when using such a defective handrail in an ordinary manner. Such a defect in a building should be deemed to be likely to undermine the fundamental safety necessary for a building, and there is also no reason to construe that the tort liability shall be found only where defects exist in the foundation or structural framework of the building.<br/><br/>
5. The determination of the court of prior instance mentioned in 3(2) above that contravenes this reasoning is illegal in that it has erroneously construed Article 709 of the Civil Code, and such illegality apparently affects the judgment. The appellants' argument is well-grounded in that it alleges such illegality, and the judgment of prior instance should inevitably be quashed with respect to the part concerning the appellants' claim to seek damages for a tort. For further examination as to whether or not the appellees should be liable for a tort, including whether or not the Building has such defects that undermine the fundamental safety necessary for a building and, if any, whether or not the appellants have suffered damage caused by such defects, this case is remanded to the court of prior instance.<br/>
The remaining part of the appellants' claim is dismissed because the reasons therefor stated in the petition for acceptance of final appeal have been excluded by the decision to accept the final appeal.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

    <Abstract>Where a basic contract has been concluded in which provision of loans and repayment of debts are expected to be repeated between the lender and the borrower, and in which it is provided that the amount of monthly repayment is fixed on the basis of the outstanding amount of loan debts as of the previous month and that the amount of interest for monthly repayment shall be calculated for the period from the date of payment in the previous month to the date of payment in the current month and based on the amount of principal that remains after repayment was made on the date of payment in the previous month, debt repayments under the basic contract are construed to be made for the entire amount borrowed under the contract. In such circumstances, it is reasonable to construe that the basic contract contains an (implied) agreement that if an overpayment occurs in the repayment of loan debts under the basic contract by paying interest that exceeds the limit set by the Interest Rate Restriction Act, and there is no other loan debt at the time of repayment, such overpayment shall be appropriated to the repayment of any new loan debt that arises later.</Abstract>

1. The final appeal is dismissed with prejudice on the merit with respect to the part of the judgment of prior instance concerning the claim for return of unjust enrichment.<br/>
2. The remaining part of the final appeal is dismissed without prejudice.<br/>
3. The appellant of final appeal shall bear the cost of final appeal.
Reasons:
Concerning Reasons I, III, and IV for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsel, MIZUNAKA Seiso, et al.<br/>
1. The outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance is as follows:<br/>
(1) The appellant of final appeal is a moneylender who engages in moneylending business under the registration prescribed in Article 3 of the Moneylending Control Act.<br/>
(2) In June 1988, the appellant concluded a credit card membership contract with the appellee of final appeal for granting membership to the appellee, and provided the appellee with a credit card named "A Card." The said contract included clauses concerning monetary loan for consumption (these clauses shall hereinafter be referred to as "Basic Contract 1"). The contents of Basic Contract 1 that applied during the period mentioned in (4) below are as follows.<br/>
(a) Borrowing method<br/>
A member may borrow money repeatedly, in units of 10,000 yen, from the appellant up to the borrowing limit.<br/>
(b) Repayment method<br/>
A member shall choose one repayment method from among: (i) the method of repaying the same amount of principal and interest every month in the designated number of installments (generally referred to as "equal monthly payment with interest"); (ii) the method of repaying an amount determined based on the outstanding balance of borrowed money as of the last day of each month (generally referred to as "outstanding balance-based sliding-scale revolving repayment"); and (iii) the method of making lump-sum payment.<br/>
(c) Interest rate for borrowed money<br/>
The interest rate for borrowed money shall be, in principle, 26.4% per annum in the case of equal monthly payment with interest, or 27.6% per annum in the case of other repayment methods.<br/>
(d) Method of calculation of interest<br/>
The amount of interest payable in each month shall be calculated by multiplying the amount of principal that remains after repayment is made on the 27th day of the preceding month, by the actual annual percentage interest rate (calculated in proportion to the number of days), for the period from the 28th day of the preceding month to the 27th day of the current month.<br/>
(e) Method of making repayment<br/>
Repayment shall be made on the 27th day of each month through account transfer from the bank account designated by each member.<br/>
(3) In December 1991, the appellant concluded a loan card membership contract with the appellee for granting membership to the appellee (hereinafter referred to as "Basic Contract 2"; this contract and Basic Contract 1 shall hereinafter be collectively referred to as the "Basic Contracts"), and provided the appellee with a loan card named "B." The contents of Basic Contract 2 that applied during the period mentioned in (4) below are as follows.<br/>
(a) Borrowing method<br/>
A member may borrow money repeatedly, in units of 10,000 yen, from the appellant up to the borrowing limit.<br/>
(b) Repayment method<br/>
A member shall choose one repayment method from among: (i) the method of making lump-sum payment in the next month; and (ii) the method of repaying an amount determined based on the outstanding balance of borrowed money as of the last day of each month (generally referred to as "outstanding balance-based sliding-scale revolving repayment").<br/>
(c) Interest rate for borrowed money: 22.6% per annum<br/>
(d) Method of calculation of interest<br/>
The amount of interest payable in each month shall be calculated with regard to the amount of principal that remains after repayment is made on the 27th day of the preceding month, for the period from the 28th day of the preceding month to the 27th day of the current month.<br/>
(e) Method of making repayment<br/>
Repayment shall be made on the 27th day of each month through account transfer from the bank account designated by each member.<br/>
(4) Under Basic Contract 1, the appellant, during the period from August 2, 1991, to January 31, 2004, lent the amounts of money to the appellee as indicated in the "Amount Borrowed" section of Calculation Sheet 2(2) attached to the judgment of prior instance, on the dates indicated in the "Date" section of the said sheet, and the appellee paid the amounts of money to the appellant as indicated in the "Amount Repaid" section of the said sheet, on the dates indicated in the "Date" section of the said sheet.<br/>
Under Basic Contract 2, the appellant, during the period from December 24, 1991 to January 31, 2004, lent the amounts of money to the appellee as indicated in the "Amount Borrowed" section of Calculation Sheet 2(1) attached to the judgment of prior instance, on the dates indicated in the "Date" section of the said sheet, and the appellee paid the amounts of money to the appellant as indicated in the "Amount Repaid" section of the said sheet, on the dates indicated in the "Date" section of the said sheet (the series of transactions carried out under each of the Basic Contracts shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Transactions").<br/><br/>
2. In this case, the appellee alleges that an overpayment occurs in the repayments of the debts arising from the money borrowed under the relevant Basic Contract if, for each Transaction, the portion of the amount of interest paid exceeding the amount calculated under the upper limit of the interest rate set by Article 1, para.1 of the Interest Rate Restriction Act (such portion shall hereinafter be referred to as the "interest paid in excess") is appropriated to the repayments of the principals, and also alleges that an overpayment still occurs even after the said overpayment is appropriated to the repayment of debts that exist at the time of repayment or debt that arose later by a new loan. Based on these allegations, the appellee seeks, from the appellant, refund of the overpayments arising from the Transactions based on the right to claim refund of unjust enrichment.<br/><br/>
3. According to the facts mentioned above, the court of second instance partially upheld the appellee's claim to seek refund of unjust enrichment from the appellant, holding as follows. Transactions should be regarded, as a whole, as a single transaction, in light of the nature of the Basic Contracts and the money borrowed thereunder and the relationship between them, for example: (i) Transactions are a series of loan transactions that were carried out in a repetitious manner under the relevant Basic Contract; (ii) Each Basic Contract provides for basic terms such as the interest rate for borrowed money and the repayment method; (iii) Upon conclusion of each Basic Contract, screening for financing was completed with regard to important matters, and screenings conducted for each loan were limited to only minimum necessary matters, e.g. whether or not the member has failed to repay a debt; (iv) Provision of loans and repayment of debts are expected to be repeated at frequent intervals up to the credit limit. Consequently, when an overpayment remains after having appropriated the interest paid in excess by the appellee in each Transaction to the repayment of the principal, if any debt arises later from a new loan, it should be construed that the said overpayment should necessarily be appropriated to the repayment of such later debt arising from the new loan.<br/><br/>
4. The reasons for final appeal argued that the court of second instance violated laws and regulations by erroneously making the above-outlined decision with regard to the appropriation of an overpayment.<br/>
Therefore, we examine the case focusing on this point. Where the lender has been providing loans to the borrower continuously and repeatedly by conducting transactions for monetary loan for consumption under the basic contract, if the borrower has voluntarily paid interest that exceeds the limit set by the Interest Rate Restriction Act for one of the loan debts, and an overpayment still exists even after such interest paid in excess is appropriated to the repayment of principal, it is reasonable to construe that such overpayment should be appropriated to the repayment of the borrower's other loan debts that exist at the time of repayment, unless there are special circumstances, for example, where the borrower and the lender have made a special agreement on appropriation (See 2001 (Ju) No. 1032, 1033, judgment of the Second Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of July 18, 2003, Minshu Vol. 57, No. 7, at 895; 2000 (Ju) No. 1000, judgment of the First Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of September 11, 2003, Saibanshu Minji No. 210, at 617). On the other hand, if there is no other loan debt at the time of repayment when an overpayment occurs, we cannot say that such overpayment should necessarily be appropriated to the repayment of any new loan debt that arises later. However, even in such case, if there is a special agreement between the lender and the borrower to the effect that any overpayment shall be appropriated to the repayment of a new loan debt, appropriation should be made in accordance with such agreement.<br/>
According to the facts mentioned above, under the Basic Contracts concluded between the appellant and the appellee in this case, the appellee may borrow money repeatedly, in units of 10,000 yen, from the appellant up to the borrowing limit. It is also provided under the contracts that: the appellee shall repay the borrowed money on the monthly due date through account transfer from the bank account designated by the appellee; the amount of monthly repayment shall be a fixed amount predetermined on the basis of the outstanding amount of loan debts as of the previous month; the amount of interest shall be calculated for the period from the date of payment in the previous month to the date of payment in the current month, based on the amount of principal that remains after repayment is made on the date of payment in the previous month. In light of these details of the contract terms, we can conclude that debt repayment under each Basic Contract is expected to be made not for each individual loan but for the entire amount borrowed under the Basic Contract, and therefore appropriation can be made for the borrowed money as a whole. Assuming so, it is reasonable to construe that each Basic Contract contains an (implied) agreement that if an overpayment remains even after appropriating the interest paid in excess in each repayment of loan debt under the contract to the repayment of the principal, such overpayment may be appropriated not only to the repayment of any other loan debt that exists at the time of repayment but also to any new loan debt that arises later. The determination of the court of second instance that goes along with this reasoning can be affirmed. The argument of the appellant cannot be accepted.<br/>
In the petition for acceptance of final appeal, the appellant also made an appeal against the part of the judgment of prior instance that decided against the appellant with regard to the appellee's claim for compensation for non-pecuniary damage from the tort of refusing the disclosure of transaction records. However, since the appellant failed to submit a document stating the reasons for the petition, we dismiss, without prejudice, the appellant's final appeal with respect to the said part.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

The judgment of prior instance is quashed.<br/>
The appeals to the court of second instance filed by the appellees of final appeal are dismissed.<br/>
The appellees of final appeal shall bear the cost of appeals to the court of second instance and the cost of final appeal.
Reasons:
I. Outline of the case<br/>
1. The appellees of final appeal are citizens of the People's Republic of China. They are persons who assert that during World War II, they were forcibly brought to Japan from North China and caused to be engaged in forced labor by the appellant of final appeal (Appellee X1, Appellee X2, the late A, the late B, and the late C; hereinafter referred to as the "Victims"), or successors of such persons. In this case, the appellees seek damages from the appellant for the appellant's failure to perform obligations, etc., alleging that the appellant breached the obligation of taking care of safety by causing the Victims to be engaged in forced labor under harsh working conditions.<br/>
The appellant challenges the alleged cause of responsibility, denying the fact of having forcibly brought the Victims to Japan or causing them to be engaged in forced labor, while also denying the existence of an employment contract or legal relationship equivalent thereto between the appellant and the Victims, from which the obligation of taking care of safety should have arisen. In addition, by invoking the extinctive prescription of the right to claim damages for nonperformance of its obligations and also asserting the waiver of claims as a result of postwar arrangement under the relevant treaties, etc., the appellant argues that its legal liability to satisfy the appellees' claims has been extinguished.<br/><br/>
2. With regard to the actual circumstances concerning the appellees' allegation of being forcibly brought to Japan and caused to be engaged in forced labor, the outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance is as follows:<br/>
(1) Triggered by the Lugou Bridge Incident in July 1937, Japan went into a state of war against China (hereinafter referred to as the "Japan-China War"), and then launched the Pacific War by the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 8, 1941. In the course of prosecuting the war, Japan faced scarcity of labor in the sectors of munitions companies requiring hard labor (e.g. mining, civil engineering and construction, and harbor loading/unloading). In order to cope with such labor shortage, the Japanese government established the national mobilization system under the National Mobilization Act promulgated in April 1938, and also took measures such as having a number of Korean workers immigrate to Japan from the Korean Peninsula which was part of Japan at that time through annexation. However, these measures were unable to solve the serious labor shortage in the hard labor sectors.<br/>
(2) Industries such as the coal industry and civil engineering industry, anticipating a labor shortage from a relatively early stage of the war, considered immigration of work force from overseas territories, particularly from North China, and made a request to the Japanese government to realize this project. In response to this request, on November 27, 1942, the Japanese government made a cabinet decision entitled "Concerning the Immigration of Chinese Workers into Japan." In this decision, according to the policy that "in light of the current situation where the labor supply in Japan has been increasingly tight and the labor shortage is serious, especially in the hard labor sectors, the government shall immigrate Chinese workers to Japan in the following manner, thereby having them cooperate in pursuing the goal of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere," it was provided that the government was going to immigrate a certain number of Chinese workers to Japan on a trial basis, and then implement immigration on a full-fledged scale while referring to the outcome of the trial. Based on this policy, the government immigrated about 1,400 Chinese workers to Japan on a trial basis during the period from April to November 1943.<br/>
(3) Based on the outcome of the trial immigration, by way of the vice-ministerial decision entitled "Concerning the Promotion of Immigration of Chinese Workers to Japan," the Japanese government formulated the guidelines and detailed procedures for the implementation of full-fledged immigration in February 1944. In addition, based on the Implementation Plan for National Mobilization of 1944 adopted by the cabinet decision in August 1944, the government laid down the policy of immigrating 290,000 Korean workers to Japan as well as implementing the full-fledged immigration of 30,000 Chinese workers to Japan. Based on these decisions, 37,524 Chinese workers in 161 groups immigrated to Japan during the period from March 1944 to May 1945.<br/>
(4) The appellant is a company engaged in civil engineering and construction, and in war time, it collaborated in the military operations of the Japanese Army moving into the mainland of China, and received a number of orders for railroad construction and road works (the appellant's trade name at that time was Y'). The appellant received an order for the construction of the Yasuno Power Plant in Yamagata-gun, Hiroshima Prefecture with a construction period from June 1943 to March 1947, but was unable to secure a sufficient number of workers for the construction. In April 1944, the appellant, in order to make up for the labor shortage with Chinese workers, filed with the Ministry of Health and Welfare, which had jurisdiction over the allocation and management of immigrated workers, an application for immigration of Chinese workers for the purpose of use in construction of the power plant, and received a quota of 300 workers. Having received the quota, the appellant concluded a contract on the recruitment and acceptance of Chinese workers with the North China Labor and Industry Association, a local organization engaged in recruiting Chinese workers. In July 1944 in Qingdao, in the presence of the Japanese Army, 360 Chinese workers were delivered from the North China Labor and Industry Association to the appellant. The five Victims were included in these Chinese workers.<br/>
(5) On July 29, 1944, the 360 Chinese workers delivered to the appellant were put on a cargo ship in Qingdao, and they arrived at the Shimonoseki Port seven days later. Among these Chinese workers on board, three workers died of illness at sea. Subsequently, the Chinese workers were brought to the workplace of the Yasuno Power Plant, placed in the accommodation facility in four groups, and put under constant surveillance of watchmen and police officers. The Chinese workers were caused to be engaged in digging headrace tunnels and in other works in day and night shifts. Since the meal served thrice a day was very poor in quantity and quality, all workers became thin and always hungry. Furthermore, supply of clothes and shoes and the maintenance of sanitary conditions was extremely inadequate, and medical treatment for injured or sick workers was also insufficient. As a result, in March 1945, 13 workers were sent back to China by reason of the incapability of working due to injury or sickness. On July 13, 1945, a conflict occurred among the Chinese workers over the distribution of slaughtered cattle, resulting in the killing by clubbing of two Chinese workers who had served as group leaders and had been regarded as enjoying favorable treatment for their cooperative behavior with the Japanese site foreman and therefore hated by other workers. Among the 16 workers suspected of taking part in this incident and detained in the Hiroshima Prison or other facilities, five workers were killed by the atomic bombing that took place on August 6, 1945, and the 11 other workers were also exposed to radiation.<br/>
(6) On August 24, 1945, after the end of the war, the appellant was given instruction by the governmental organization to stop using Chinese workers at the workplace of the Yasuno Power Plant, and stopped using them as instructed. Subsequently, according to the instruction of the Allied Powers to send the Chinese workers back to China, the workers were transported from the workplace of the power plant on November 24, 1945, and then sent back to China from Haenosaki, Nagasaki Prefecture, on November 29. By the date of returning home, among the 360 Chinese workers initially brought into Japan, 26 workers had died in addition to the three workers who had died on the way to Japan. Among the total number of Chinese workers immigrated to Japan and accepted by Japanese workplaces (38,935 workers), 6,830 workers or 17.5% died before going back home.<br/>
(7) After the war, the association of the civil engineering and construction companies that had accepted Chinese workers lodged petitions to the government repeatedly, demanding compensation for various damages allegedly arising from the acceptance of Chinese workers. In March 1946, the government decided to take measures to partially accept their demand. Finally, the appellant obtained about 920,000 yen as compensation.<br/>
(8) Before brought to Japan, the Victims had lived everyday life with their families. However, they were deceived with job offers or forcibly put onto trucks suddenly, and brought to the detention centers directly or after being captured by the Japanese Army as war prisoners. Subsequently, as explained above, they were immigrated to Japan and caused to be engaged in labor at the workplace of the Yasuno Power Plant. In the course of these events, they did not give consent to go to Japan and work for the appellant based on notice in advance, nor did they conclude an employment contract with the appellant.<br/>
Among the Victims, Appellee X1 (aged 16 at the time of immigration) lost sight in both eyes when involved in the accident of trolley derailment that occurred during work. Appellee X2 (aged 18 at the time of immigration) became bedridden due to serious scabies. They both became incapable of working and therefore they were sent back to China in March 1945. The late A (aged 23 at the time of immigration) and the late B (aged 21 or 22 at the time of immigration) were caught in the atomic bombing while they were detained as suspects of the killing of the group leaders described in (5) above. The atomic bombing killed B and left aftereffects on A. The late C (aged 18 or 19 at the time of immigration) was, one day, forced to go to work despite a bad health condition due to a high fever, and beaten by the site foreman by reason of his negligence of work, finally dead.<br/><br/>
3. With regard to the waiver of claims, etc. as postwar arrangements, the outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance (including the publicly known facts) is as follows:<br/>
(1) After World War II, Japan was placed under the occupation of the Allied Powers. On September 8, 1951, in the city of San Francisco, Japan entered into the Treaty of Peace with Japan (hereinafter referred to as the "San Francisco Peace Treaty") with the 48 Allied Powers, and regained its independence upon the treaty coming into force on April 28, 1952. The San Francisco Peace Treaty, which established the basic outline of the postwar arrangements for Japan, aimed to terminate the state of war between Japan and each of the Allied Powers (Article 1(a)), have the Allied Powers recognize the sovereignty of the Japanese people (Article 1(b)), and ultimately solve the issues concerning the territory (Chapter 2), and the claims and property (Chapter 5). However, as will be explained later, Japan was unable to conclude peace with all Allied Powers because China (meaning the State of China with which Japan fought in the Japan-China War; the same shall apply hereinafter) was not invited to the peace conference, India, etc. did not accept invitation, and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, etc. refused to sign the treaty.<br/>
(2) The San Francisco Peace Treaty includes the following provisions concerning war reparations and treatment of claims, etc.<br/>
(a) It is recognized that Japan should pay reparations to the Allied Powers for the damage and suffering caused by it during the war. Nevertheless it is also recognized that the resources of Japan are not presently sufficient, if it is to maintain a viable economy, to make complete reparation for all such damage and suffering and at the same time meet its other obligations (the principal paragraph of Article 14(a)).<br/>
(b) Japan will promptly enter into negotiations with Allied Powers so desiring, whose present territories were occupied by Japanese forces and damaged by Japan, with a view to assisting to compensate those countries for the cost of repairing the damage done, by making available the services of the Japanese people in production, salvaging and other work for the Allied Powers in question (Article 14(a)1; the offering of services under this provision may hereinafter be referred to as "service reparation.")<br/>
(c) Each of the Allied Powers shall have the right to seize, retain, liquidate or otherwise dispose of all property, rights and interests of Japan and Japanese nationals, etc., which on the first coming into force of the present Treaty were subject to its jurisdiction (excluding some specified property such as property of Japanese natural persons who during the war resided with the permission of the Government concerned in the territory of one of the Allied Powers) (Article 14(a)2).<br/>
(d) Except as otherwise provided in the present Treaty, the Allied Powers waive all reparations claims of the Allied Powers, other claims of the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of any actions taken by Japan and its nationals in the course of the prosecution of the war, and claims of the Allied Powers for direct military costs of occupation (Article 14(b)).<br/>
(e) Japan waives all claims of Japan and its nationals against the Allied Powers and their nationals arising out of the war or out of actions taken because of the existence of a state of war, and waives all claims arising from the presence, operations or actions of forces or authorities of any of the Allied Powers in Japanese territory prior to the coming into force of the present Treaty (Article 19(a)).<br/>
(3) Although China should have been invited to the peace conference as one of the Allied Powers, both the government of the People's Republic of China, which had been established in 1949, and the government of the Republic of China, which had been driven out of the mainland of China by the former and had moved its base to Taiwan, proclaimed themselves as the only legitimate government representative of China, and opinions were also divided among the Allied Powers regarding which government should be recognized as the government of China. Because of this, neither of the governments were invited to the peace conference. Nevertheless, with regard to Japan's renouncement of its special rights and interest in China (Article 10 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty) and disposition of Japan's overseas assets (Article 14(a)2 of the same treaty), it was recognized that China was entitled to the benefits of the treaty (Article 21).<br/>
(4) Subsequently, the government of Japan entered into negotiations with each of the Allied Powers for service reparations under the provision mentioned in (2)(b) above and other issues, and also started negotiations with the nations and regions that did not participate in the San Francisco Peace Treaty so as to enter into bilateral peace treaties which would form a framework for postwar arrangements. In this process, the biggest problem was the relationship with China, which had not been invited to the peace conference. On April 28, 1952, the government of Japan recognized the government of the Republic of China as the legitimate government of China, and entered with it into the Treaty of Peace between Japan and the Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the "Japan-ROC Peace Treaty"), which came into force on August 5, 1952. The Japan-ROC Peace Treaty provided that the state of war between Japan and the Republic of China shall be terminated on the day when the treaty comes into force (Article 1), and that the issues arising between the two countries from the state of war shall be solved in accordance with the relevant provisions of the San Francisco Peace Treaty (Article 11). In the Protocol, which is an integral part the treaty, it is provided that the Republic of China shall, as a token of its magnanimity and good will, voluntarily waive the benefit of the services to be made available by Japan pursuant to Article 14(a)1 of the San Francisco Peace Treaty (Protocol 1(b)). Furthermore, in the exchange of notes attached to the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty, it is confirmed that the provisions of the treaty shall be applicable to all territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of the government of the Republic of China.<br/>
(5) In China, a conflict continued to exist between the governments of the People's Republic of China and Republic of China over the status of the legitimate government of China. Under such circumstances, the government of Japan, when TANAKA Kakuei was the Prime Minister, decided to recognize the government of the People's Republic of China, instead of the government of the Republic of China, as the legitimate government of China. Following the negotiations for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China, on September 29, 1972, the Joint Communique of the Government of Japan and the Government of the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the "Japan-China Joint Communique") was finally signed. The Joint Communique includes the following provisions: "The abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between Japan and the People's Republic of China is terminated on the date on which this Joint Communique is issued" (Para.1); "The Government of Japan recognizes that Government of the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China." (Para.2); "The Government of the People's Republic of China declares that in the interest of the friendship between the Chinese and the Japanese peoples, it renounces its demand for war reparation from Japan." (Para.5)<br/>
On August 12, 1978, the government of Japan and the government of the People's Republic of China entered into the Treaty of Peace and Friendship between Japan and the People's Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the "Japan-China Peace and Friendship Treaty"), which came into force on October 23, 1978. In the preamble of the treaty, it is provided that both countries confirm that the principles enunciated in the Joint Communique should be strictly observed.<br/><br/>
4. The court of the second instance entirely upheld the appellees' claims to seek payment to each of them of 5,500,000 yen with delay damages, on the following grounds.<br/>
(1) The series of acts conducted by the appellant, i.e. receiving Chinese workers including the Victims in Qingdao, transferring them to Japan, and causing them to be engaged in harsh labor at the construction site of the Yasuno Power Plant, should inevitably be criticized as forcibly bringing these workers into Japan and causing them to be engaged in forced labor.<br/>
(2) Although the appellant did not conclude a contract directly with these Chinese workers, there was a special relationship similar to employment between the parties, and the appellant should be deemed to have assumed the obligation of taking care of safety as its ancillary obligation. Since it is obvious that the appellant did not fulfill this obligation, the appellant should inevitably be held responsible for nonperformance of obligation.<br/>
(3) It should be deemed that it had not been objectively possible for Appellees X1 and X2 and the persons to whom other appellees succeeded to actually exercise the right to claim damages for the breach of the obligation of taking care of safety, until the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of the Exit and Entry of Citizens was put into force in 1986, opening a path for Chinese citizens to go abroad, and therefore it should be construed that the extinctive prescription of the aforementioned right to claim damages commenced to run from the date of enforcement of the said Law. Under such understanding, the 10-year period of prescription had already expired by the time of the filing of this suit but it had not yet expired at the time when Appellees X1 and X2 and the persons to whom other appellees succeeded entered into negotiations for compensation with the appellant in August 1993. During the period between these points of time, Appellees X1 and X2 and the persons to whom other appellees succeeded seem to have been facing extreme difficulty in actually exercising the right to claim damages due to economic hardship and lack of information. It cannot be denied that these obstacles (economic hardship and lack of information) were caused partly because the appellant had forcibly brought the Victims and caused them to be engaged in forced labor. The appellant benefited from the acceptance of Chinese workers by obtaining state compensation. The appellant prolonged the compensation negotiations with the appellees while avoiding showing a clear stance, thereby delaying the filing of the suit. Taking into consideration all of these circumstances, the appellant's attempt to invoke extinctive prescription is impermissible as an abuse of right.<br/>
(4) The appellant argues that as a result of the wavier of claims under the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty or the Japan-China Joint Communique, the legal liability of Japan and Japanese citizens to satisfy the appellees' claims in this suit has been extinguished. However, Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique does not expressly provide waiver of claims held by Chinese citizens, and what the government of the People's Republic of China is to renounce under the Joint Communique is nothing more than its "demand for war reparation." Furthermore, since the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty was entered into between Japan and the Republic of China, it is questionable whether the treaty is directly applicable to the appellees, who are citizens of the People's Republic of China. Consequently, the appellant's argument mentioned above cannot be accepted.<br/><br/>
II. Concerning Reason 4 for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsels, HIGUCHI Shunji, TAKANO Yasuhiko, and IHOTA Toshiharu<br/>
1. The appeal counsels allege that the determination of the court of second instance mentioned in I-4(4) above is in violation of laws and regulations. We cannot affirm the part of the said determination rejecting the appellant's defense of waive of claims under the Japan-China Joint Communique, on the following grounds.<br/><br/>
2. Concerning the waiver of claims as the basic principle of postwar arrangements<br/>
(1) The San Francisco Peace Treaty, which established the basic outline of the postwar arrangements for Japan, endorsed Japan's obligation to make war reparations (money and other benefits to be provided by the defeated country to the victor country upon concluding peace between them) for the Allied Powers, and entrusted the Allied Powers with the disposition of Japan's overseas assets under the jurisdiction of the Allied Powers with the view to effectively appropriating such assets to cover part of war reparations (Article 14(a)2). On the other hand, the treaty gave consideration to Japan's debt capacity, by recognizing that the resources of Japan were not sufficient to make complete reparation (principal paragraph of Article 14(a)), and declared that specific arrangements for war reparations including service reparation shall be determined through negotiations between Japan and each of the Allied Powers (Article 14(a)1). The basis of such arrangements for war reparations was "disposition of claims." In this context, the term "disposition of claims" refers to disposition of claims arising between the nations at war or nationals thereof in the course of prosecution of the war, which can be negotiated separately from war reparations. With regard to such claims, including claims held by individuals, the treaty declared that Japan and the Allied Powers should mutually waive all claims arising between them and their nationals (which has been constructed to include juridical persons) in the course of prosecution of the war (Article 14(b), Article 19(a)).<br/>
(2) Thus, the San Francisco Peace Treaty established a framework for postwar arrangements for Japan wherein, on condition that Japan and the Allied Powers should mutually waive all claims arising in the course of prosecution of the war, including claims held by individuals, Japan shall admit its obligation to make war reparations for the Allied Powers and entrust the Allied Powers with the disposition of its overseas assets under the jurisdiction of the Allied Powers, and agreed that specific arrangements for war reparations including service reparation would be decided through individual negotiations with each of the Allied Powers. In light of the significance of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, which was entered into between Japan and the 48 Allied Powers and by which Japan regained its independence, the said framework should have been effective also when Japan entered into peace treaties, etc. with the nations and regions that did not participate in the San Francisco Peace Treaty in order to make postwar arrangements (this framework shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty"). The Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty was designed to achieve the objective of the peace treaty, i.e. ultimately terminating the state of war between Japan and the 48 Allied Powers and building unshakable friendly relationships between them for the future. The reason why such a framework was established may be that if, despite the entry into the peace treaty, the issues concerning various claims arising in the course of prosecution of the war were to be solved by way of the exercise of rights in individual, ex-post civil litigations, that would cause both Japan and the Allied Powers as well as their citizens to shoulder excessive burden that could hardly be predicted at the time of the entry into the peace treaty and thereby bring about confusion, which might be an obstacle to the achievement of the objective of the peace treaty.<br/>
(3) Considering that the purpose of the waiver of claims under the Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty is to avoid leaving the issues concerning claims to the solution by way of the exercise of rights in individual, ex-post civil litigations, it is appropriate to construe that the term "waiver" of claims in this context does not mean to effectively extinguish claims but it only means to have the competency of these claims in litigations lost. Therefore, even after all claims arising in the course of prosecution of the war have been waived under the Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the obligors are not prevented from voluntarily and spontaneously taking measures to satisfy specific claims in light of the contents thereof. In this respect, as publicly known, with regard to the interpretation of the provision of Article 14(b) of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, Prime Minister YOSHIDA Shigeru declared the possibility that Japan would take such voluntary measures in his letter addressed to the representative of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Minister of Foreign Affairs Stikker.<br/>
The appellees argue that, apart from the case where nations waive their right of diplomatic protection, private rights that are inherent for citizens cannot be restricted by an agreement between nations. However, upon entering into a peace treaty to end a war, each nation has the power to dispose all relevant claims including claims held by individuals based on its sovereignty over its citizens. Therefore, the appellees' argument cannot be accepted.<br/>
(4) Following the entry into the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the government of Japan and the governments of the contracting states held negotiations according to the treaty regarding war reparations including service reparation, which resulted in the entry into bilateral reparation agreements (with the Republic of the Philippines, etc.) or the waiver of claims for reparations (by the Lao People's Democratic Republic, etc.). These agreements were of course made based on the mutual waiver of claims including claims held by individuals. The government of Japan carried out measures for resolution of war reparation issues and disposition of claims by also entering into bilateral peace treaties or reparation agreements with each of the nations and regions that did not participate in the San Francisco Peace Treaty. These bilateral treaties and agreements also expressly provide that both parties shall mutually waive all claims arising in the course of prosecution of the war, including claims held by individuals (Article 6 of the Treaty of Peace between Japan and India, Article 5 of the Treaty of Peace between Japan and the Union of Burma, Article 3 of the Agreement between Japan and Thailand concerning Settlement of "Special Yen Problem", Article 3 of the Japan-Holland Reparations Protocol regarding some Private Claims from Hollanders, Para.6 of the Japan-Soviet Joint Declaration, Article 4 of the Agreement on the Reestablishment of Normal Relations between Japan and the People's Republic of Poland, Article 4 of the of Peace Treaty between Japan and the Republic of Indonesia, Article 2 of the Agreement of September 21, 1967, between Japan and the Republic of Singapore, Article 3 of the Agreement between Japan and the United States of America on the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands). The provision of Article 2 of the Agreement of September 21, 1967, between Japan and Malaysia is written in a somewhat abstract way, which may be the only exception: "The government of Malaysia agrees that all problems arising from the unfortunate incidents that occurred during World War II, which might affect a good relationship between Japan and Malaysia, have been hereby settled completely and ultimately." This agreement cannot be construed to provide for disposition of claims that is different from the disposition of claims under the San Francisco Peace Treaty and the subsequent bilateral peace treaties. Article 2 of the agreement can also be construed to mean to follow the Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty wherein Japan and the contracting parties agreed to waive all claims arising in the prosecution of the war, including claims held by individuals.<br/><br/>
3. Concerning the waiver of claims under the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty<br/>
(1) As explained above, the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty entered into with the government of the Republic of China addresses postwar arrangements between Japan and China. Article 11 of the treaty provides that "any problem arising between Japan and the Republic of China as a result of the existence of a state of war" shall be settled in accordance with the relevant provisions of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. This provision can be construed to necessarily cover the issue of disposition of claims including claims held by individuals. Therefore, we should construe that all claims of China and Chinese citizens arising in the course of prosecution of the Japan-China War have been waived in accordance with Article 14(b) of the San Francisco Peace Treaty. Furthermore, as mentioned above, Protocol 1(b) provides that the Republic of China shall, "as a sign of magnanimity and good will towards the Japanese people," voluntarily waive service reparation.<br/>
(2) By the time of the conclusion of the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty in 1952, the government of the Republic of China had been driven away from the mainland of China and its control had been limited to the Island of Taiwan and other neighboring islands. Therefore, it may be questionable whether or not the government of the Republic of China had the power to enter into a peace treaty to make peace after the Japan-China War. However, although the countries were divided into two groups at that time regarding which government should be recognized as the government of China, i.e. those supporting the government of the Republic of China (e.g. the United States), and those supporting the government of the People's Republic of China (e.g. the United Kingdom), the former group outnumbered the latter group. In addition, as is publicly known, it is the government of the Republic of China that held the authority to represent China in the United Nations. Under such circumstances, the government of Japan recognized the government of the Republic of China as the legitimate government of China, and for this reason, it should be concluded that there was no obstacle to the government of the Republic of China in entering into a peace treaty to make peace after the Japan-China War.<br/>
(3) However, it is true, as explained above, that at the time of the conclusion of the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty, the control of the government of the Republic of China was limited to the Island of Taiwan and other neighboring islands, and in light of this fact, the exchange of notes attached to the treaty stated that "the terms of the present Treaty shall, in respect of the Republic of China, be applicable to all the territories which are now, or which may hereafter be, under the control of its Government." We should find it fully possible to construe this statement to only indicate the possibility of applying the provisions on war reparations and disposition of claims to the mainland of China that was under the control of the government of the People's Republic of China.<br/>
Consequently, we cannot firmly conclude that Article 11 of the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty and Protocol 1(b) providing for war reparations and waiver of claims, including claims held by individuals, are applicable in the mainland of China which was never placed under the control of the government of the Republic of China after the conclusion of the treaty. Nor can we consider that these provisions are necessarily effective with regard to Chinese citizens who live in the mainland of China. Since it is obvious that the appellees are Chinese citizens who live in the mainland of China, we cannot conclude that the wavier of claims under the treaty is necessarily effective with regard to the appellees.<br/><br/>
4. Waiver of claims under Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique<br/>
(1) Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique states as follows: "The Government of the People's Republic of China declares that in the interest of the friendship between the Chinese and the Japanese peoples, it renounces its demand for war reparation from Japan." When reading this language, we must say that the statement does not clearly specify who is entitled to "demand" war reparation that is to be renounced under the Joint Communique, or more specifically, it is not very clear whether the statement means to cover disposition of claims in addition to war reparations between Japan and China, and if it covers disposition of claims, whether it means to cover the waiver of claims held by individual citizens of the People's Republic of China.<br/>
(2) However, reviewing the negotiation process which has been publicly known to date based on the evidential materials such as the publicly disclosed official records on the negotiations for the normalization of diplomatic relations between Japan and China as well as the memories written by the persons involved in the negotiations, we should construe that the Japan-China Joint Communique is a peace treaty in its substance, and we cannot construe that the Joint Communique provides for arrangements for war reparations and disposition of claims that are different from those under the Framework for the San Francisco Peace Treaty.<br/>
(a) In the Japan-China negotiations for the normalization of diplomatic relations, the government of the People's Republic of China insisted on treatment based on the three principles for the restoration of relations: (i) The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government to represent China; (ii) Taiwan is an integral part of the territory of the People's Republic of China; (iii) The Japan-ROC Peace Treaty is unlawful and void, and therefore should be repealed. From the viewpoint of the People's Republic of China and these three principles, peace had not yet been made after the Japan-China War, and therefore the government of the People's Republic of China needed to make the Japan-China Joint Communique also serve as a peace treaty, and in this context, a declaration of the end of the war and provisions on war reparations and disposition of claims were indispensable in the Joint Communique.<br/>
On the other hand, the government of Japan had recognized the government of the Republic of China as the legitimate government of China and entered into the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty with that government. Due to this background, the government of Japan might have been able to terminate the treaty, but with regard to the issues concerning the end of the Japan-China War as well as war reparations and disposition of claims, it had no choice other than to stand on the premise that these issues had already been formally settled under the treaty (Although, as explained above, it cannot be firmly concluded that the provisions of the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty on war reparations and disposition of claims are applicable in the mainland of China, the government of Japan at that time did not have such a view).<br/>
(b) In the Japan-China negotiations for the normalization of diplomatic relations, the government of the People's Republic of China and the government of Japan fully recognized that they inevitably had to promote the negotiations based on their own premises described above, and therefore, in an attempt to realize postwar arrangements relating to the Japan-China War that would be compatible with both parties' standpoints, efforts were made to find a suitable expression to be included in the Joint Communique. As a result, in the Premise of the Japan-China Joint Communique, it was stated that Japan would take the "position to fully understand" the three principles for the restoration of relations advocated by the government of the People's Republic of China. The expression of the provision of Para.1 of the Japan-China Joint Communique, "The abnormal state of affairs that has hitherto existed between Japan and the People's Republic of China is terminated on the date on which this Joint Communique is issued," was adopted because it could be construed, from the standpoint of China, to be a declaration of the end of the Japan-China War, whereas from the standpoint of Japan, it could be construed to mean that the lack of diplomatic relations between Japan and the People's Republic of China had been solved.<br/>
(c) In light of the process of the Japan-China negotiations for the normalization of diplomatic relations described above, the government of the People's Republic of China obviously regards Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique as a creative provision for establishing all postwar arrangements covering not only war reparations but also disposition of claims. The government of Japan can be deemed to have also agreed about the expression of the provision of the said paragraph, while maintaining its view that the issues of war reparations and disposition of claims were already settled under the Japan-ROC Peace Treaty but also recognizing the said paragraph as meaning to confirm that in relation to the government of the People's Republic of China, substantially the same arrangements as those under the said treaty have been made. We should conclude that the Japan-China Joint Communique issued through the process explained above is in substance a peace treaty not only for the government of the People's Republic of China but also for the government of Japan.<br/>
As mentioned above, it is obvious that the Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty was critically significant for achieving the objective of the peace treaty, and that it would hinder the achievement of the objective of the peace treaty to, departing from this framework, only settle the issue of war reparations while leaving the issue of disposition of claims unsolved, or exclude claims held by individuals from the scope of claims to be waived. Also with regard to the Japan-China Joint Communique, we cannot find any circumstances where, upon its issuance, both parties inevitably had to choose to settle the issue of disposition of claims in such an inappropriate manner. Nor can we find any evidence showing that any question was proposed or discussed from such a perspective in the Japan-China negotiations for the normalization of diplomatic relations. Therefore, we cannot construe that the Japan-China Joint Communique provides for arrangements that are different from those under the Framework for the San Francisco Peace Treaty only because the language of the provision of Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique does not clearly specify individuals as the subject who are entitled to "demand" war reparation.<br/>
(d) Consequently, we should conclude that the Japan-China Joint Communique is intended, as the Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, to clearly declare that both countries will mutually waive all claims arising in the course of prosecution of the war, including claims held by individuals.<br/>
(3) Based on the interpretation of the provision of Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique shown above, we examine whether the said provision has the nature of legal norm and legal effect.<br/>
Firstly, since the Japan-China Joint Communique has not been treated as a treaty or ratified by the Diet in Japan, a question could arise as to whether or not it can be a legal norm under international law. However, it is obvious that the People's Republic of China recognized the Joint Communique as a creative legal norm in international law, and in this context, we can acknowledge that the Joint Communique is a legal norm at least as a unilateral declaration made by the People's Republic of China. Furthermore, in the Japan-China Peace and Friendship Treaty that is indisputably categorized as a treaty under international law, it has been confirmed that the principles enunciated in the Joint Communique should be strictly observed, and because of this, the contents of Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique should be deemed to have acquired the nature of legal norm as a treaty in Japan as well. In any case, it is obvious that the Joint Communique can be recognized as having the nature of legal norm under international law.<br/>
As explained above, since under the Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the waiver of claims means forfeiture of competency to make requests based on the claims at court, there is no need to take measures under domestic law to give effect to such forfeiture, and therefore the waiver of claims provided in Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique should be deemed to be effective also under national law.<br/>
(4) Consequently, it should be concluded that with regard to the claims of citizens of the People's Republic of China against Japan or Japanese citizens or juridical persons arising in the course of prosecution of the Japan-China War, the competency of citizens of the People's Republic of China to make requests based on their claims at court should be deemed to have been lost by Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique, and where such a claim is asserted at court and the obligor argues, as a defense, the waiver of the claim under the said paragraph of the Joint Communique, the claim should inevitability be dismissed.<br/><br/>
5. Conclusion<br/>
The claims asserted in this suit are claims for damages for the breach of the obligation of taking care of safety that occurred when forcibly bringing Chinese workers into Japan and causing them to be engaged in forced labor in the course of prosecution of the Japan-China War. According to the facts mentioned above, the Victims are found to have suffered tremendous pains mentally and physically, but we must say that their claims are included in the scope of claims waived under Para.5 of the Japan-China Joint Communique, and although voluntary measures may be taken to satisfy the claims, the Victims should not be allowed to assert their claims at court. Consequently, the appellant's defense arguing the waiver of claims is well-grounded, and the determination of the court of second instance that is contrary to this reasoning contains a violation of laws and regulations that apparently affects the judgment. The appellant's argument is well-grounded, and the judgment of prior instance should inevitably be quashed. Based on our holdings shown above, without needing to make judgment on other points, we should conclude that the appellees' claims are groundless, and the judgment of the court of the first instance that dismissed their claims is justifiable in its conclusion. Therefore, the appeals to the court of second instance filed by the appellees of final appeal should be dismissed.<br/>
Lastly, as explained in 2(3) above, even under the Framework of the San Francisco Peace Treaty, the obligors are not prevented from voluntarily and spontaneously taking measures to satisfy specific claims. Taking into consideration various circumstances concerned, e.g. the Victims suffered tremendous pains mentally and physically whereas the appellant received considerable benefits by causing Chinese workers to be engaged in forced labor under the aforementioned harsh working conditions and it further obtained state compensation, we expect the appellant and other parties concerned to make efforts to give relief to the Victims.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.

The final appeal is dismissed.<br/>
The appellant of final appeal shall bear the cost of final appeal.
Reasons:
Concerning the reasons for petition for acceptance of final appeal argued by the appeal counsel, ISHIDA Eiji<br/>
1. In this case, the appellee of final appeal seeks, from the appellant of final appeal, payment of the principal of the automatic renewal time deposit (two million yen), with interest thereon at the agreed rate of 3.86% per annum for the period from February 24, 1987, the day following the date of deposit, until the completion of payment, and delay damages thereon.<br/><br/>
2. The outline of the facts legally determined by the court of second instance is as follows:<br/>
(1) On February 23, 1987, the appellee deposited two million yen with Credit Cooperative Association A under the following terms (the deposit contract established by this deposit shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Deposit Contract").<br/>
(a) Interest rate: 3.86% per annum<br/>
(b) Term: one year<br/>
(c) Maturity date: February 23, 1988<br/>
(2) The Deposit Contract includes, inter alia, the following special provision: the Deposit Contract shall be automatically renewed on the maturity date as a new deposit contract for the term of the same length as the previous term, and the depositor, when he/she intends to stop renewal of the Deposit Contract, shall notify the association of such intention before the maturity date (this notification shall hereinafter be referred to as a "notification to stop renewal") (this special provision is similar to that contained in automatic renewal time deposit contracts that are usually used by ordinary financial institutions; hereinafter referred to as "special provision on automatic renewal" ). According to this special provision, where the depositor has given a notice of termination of the Deposit Contract but Credit Cooperative Association A does not accept it, the depositor cannot immediately receive a refund of deposit money. The depositor can only receive a refund after the maturity date comes and automatic renewal is stopped thereafter.<br/>
(3) Subsequently, Credit Cooperative Association A became Credit Cooperative Association B through merger. On August 19, 2002, Credit Cooperative Association B transferred the whole of its business to the appellant.<br/>
(4) On August 13, 2002, the appellee gave Credit Cooperative Association B a notice of termination of the Deposit Contract by presenting a certificate of time deposit pertaining to the Deposit Contract (this notice of termination shall hereinafter be referred to as the "Notice of Termination"), and demanded a refund of the deposit money under the contract (hereinafter referred to as the "Deposit Money").<br/>
Credit Cooperative Association B, however, did not accept the Notice of Termination, arguing that the Deposit Money had already been refunded.<br/>
(5) On June 23, 2003, the appellee filed this suit. On the first date for oral argument in the first instance (September 5, 2003), the appellant asserted that the Deposit Contract had been canceled on May 26, 1987, about three months after the conclusion of the contract and the Deposit Money had been refunded. The appellant also asserted that the extinctive prescription of the right to claim a refund of the Deposit Money had already been completed.<br/><br/>
3. Both the court of the first instance and the court of the second instance held that they cannot find the fact that the Deposit Money had been refunded. With regard to the completion of the extinctive prescription of the right to claim a refund of the Deposit Money, on the other hand, the court of the first instance dismissed the appellee's claim on the grounds that the prescription commenced to run from February 23, 1988, the first maturity date that came after the Deposit Contract had been concluded (hereinafter referred to as the "initial maturity date"), and the prescription had been completed when ten years had elapsed since that date. In contrast, the court of second instance quashed the judgment of the first instance and upheld the appellee's claim, holding that the extinctive prescription commenced to run from February 23, 2003, the first maturity date that came after the Notice of Termination had been given, and therefore the prescription had not yet been completed.<br/><br/>
4.(1) A special provision on automatic renewal included in an automatic renewal time deposit contract is intended to, unless the depositor demands a refund on the maturity date, renew the contract with regard to the principal or both the principle and interest thereon which has been agreed to be refunded on the maturity date, as a new time deposit contract for the term of deposit of the same length as the previous term, without requiring any particular act to be made by the parties to the contract (see 1999 (Ju) No. 320, judgment of the Second Petty Bench of the Supreme Court of March 16, 2001, Saibanshu Minji No. 201, at 441). The extinctive prescription shall commence to run when it has become possible to exercise the right (Article 166, para.1 of the Civil Code). However, under an automatic renewal time deposit contract, when the maturity date has passed, a new maturity date becomes the due date of refund, and this takes place repeatedly as long as the special provision on automatic renewal remains effective. Therefore, the depositor who has given a notice of termination cannot exercise the right to claim a refund of deposit money at his/her discretion during the period between the maturity date and the new maturity date. This means that even after the initial maturity date, the depositor should face a legal obstacle that prevents him/her from exercising the right to claim a refund of deposit money.<br/>
It is true that according to the special provision on automatic renewal, the depositor who has concluded the automatic renewal time deposit contract can, by giving a notification to stop renewal before the maturity date (or a new maturity date if the contract has been renewed), unilaterally eliminate the agreement between the parties that a new maturity date that is to come after the coming maturity date shall be the due date of refund, and demand a refund of deposit money. However, in light of the contents of an automatic renewal time deposit contract, it is obvious that the contract is concluded because both parties to the contract recognize the significance of automatic renewal of the maturity date, and whether or not to give a notification to stop renewal should be deemed to be left to the depositor's discretion under the deposit contract. Therefore, if we, presupposing that the depositor would demand a refund of deposit money on the initial maturity date by giving a notification to stop renewal before the initial maturity date comes, construe for the purpose of deciding when the extinctive prescription commences to run that the depositor can exercise the right to claim a refund of deposit money on the initial maturity date (and therefore the extinctive prescription commences to run from that date), it is as if we virtually compel the depositor to make an act which is left to the depositor's discretion under the contract. We must say that such construction is contrary to the purpose of the automatic renewal time deposit contract. It follows that we cannot construe that the extinctive prescription of the right to claim a refund of deposit money commences to run from the initial maturity date only because it is possible for the depositor to give a notification to stop renewal before the initial maturity date.<br/>
Consequently, it is appropriate to construe that the extinctive prescription of the right to claim a refund of deposit money under an automatic renewal time deposit contract commences to run from the maturity date on which automatic renewal thereafter is completely stopped by the depositor's notice of termination.<br/>
(2) According to the facts mentioned above, it can be construed that automatic renewal of the Deposit Contract was completely stopped on February 23, 2003, the first maturity date that came after the day on which Notice of Termination was given (August 13, 2002), and therefore we should conclude that the extinctive prescription of the right to claim a refund of the Deposit Money commenced to run from the said maturity date.<br/><br/>
5. For the reasons stated above, the determination of the court of second instance upholding the appellee's claim can be affirmed as justifiable. The appellant's argument cannot be accepted.<br/><br/>
Therefore, the judgment has been rendered in the form of the main text by the unanimous consent of the Justices.
