1. Where a live-in caretaker of a condominium was intermittently engaged in certain duties during some hours before and after the scheduled working hours, given the facts that (i) the employer instructed the caretaker to perform, at scheduled times during these hours outside the scheduled working hours, the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office, locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, turning on and off the air-conditioners, etc., (ii) the manual prepared by the employer stated that the caretaker should respond to requests from residents, etc. for receipt and delivery of parcels, etc. at any time even outside the scheduled working hours, and (iii) the employer received periodical reports on his/her duties from the caretaker and recognized the fact that the caretaker actually responded to requests from residents, etc. even outside the scheduled working hours, the caretaker should be deemed to have been under the control of the employer during these hours outside the described working hours, including the hours during which the caretaker stayed in the room next to the caretaker's office and was not actually engaged in work, and therefore these hours should be regarded as working hours for the purpose of Article 32 of the Labor Standards Act.
2. Where a husband and wife who worked as live-in caretakers of a condominium were, under instruction of their employer, engaged in the same duties on Saturdays, which is designated as a day off under their employment contract, as those duties to be performed on weekdays, given the facts that the employer gave clear instruction to the caretakers that only one of them should be engaged in work on Saturdays, and they consented to this instruction, and that the volume of duties on Saturdays cannot be deemed to be too large to be handled by a single person, it is appropriate to calculate the number of working hours on Saturdays by deeming that only either one of them was engaged in their duties.
3. Where a live-in caretaker of a condominium was intermittently engaged in certain duties on days designated as days off under his/her employment contract other than Saturdays, given the facts that the employer did not clearly instruct the caretakers to perform the duties on such days off except for the duties of turning on and off the light of the caretaker's office and locking and unlocking the door of the trash depository, only the hours during which the caretakers were actually engaged in the duties that the employer explicitly or implicitly instructed him/her to perform should be regarded as working hours for the purpose of Article 32 of the Labor Standards Act.

1. A claim for damages for a default or tort, which is held by a person who has consigned a transaction to a member of a commodity exchange vis-a-vis said member, does not fall within the scope of "claims arising from consignment" set forth in Article 97-3, para.1 of the Commodity Exchange Act (prior to the revision by Act No. 43 of 2004).
2.

Given the facts that a number of money loans were provided over many years, without concluding a basic contract, by the same lender to the same borrower repeatedly and continuously, except for one of them, for the purpose of replacing the previous loans and providing additional loans, and that even said exceptional loan was close in time to the immediately preceding repayment and was provided by the same method and under the same terms as those for the previous and subsequent loans, and therefore all these loans should be deemed to be a single consecutive loan transaction, it is appropriate to construe that the contracts for money loans for consumption for these loans contain an implied agreement that if an overpayment occurs in the repayment of loan debts arising from these loans by paying interest at a rate exceeding the limit set by the Interest Rate Restriction Act, such overpayment would be appropriated to the repayment of any new loan debt that arises later.

1. Where a moneylender, upon providing a loan under the agreement that repayment shall be made by equal monthly payments with interest, provided a borrower with a copy of a loan bond while believing that the copy can be regarded as a document required by Article 17, para.1 of the Moneylending Control Act, based on the facts of this case that (i) the copy of the loan bond indicates, in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section, the statement, "As indicated in the reimbursement schedule attached hereto," with a particular amount of principal and interest to be repaid, which means that it was intended that a reimbursement schedule constituted one and the same document together with the copy of the loan bond and that the amount of repayment for each installment shall be clarified by such integrated document, and (ii) the amount of repayment for the last installment indicated in the reimbursement schedule is inconsistent with the amount indicated in the "Amount of Repayment for Each Installment" section as the amount of principal and interest to be repaid, it cannot be deemed that a document stating the "amount of repayment" for each installment as required under Article 17, para.1 of the said Act has been provided, unless the reimbursement schedule is provided.
2. Where a moneylender has received an amount of interest exceeding the upper limit under Article 1, para.1 of the Interest Rate Restriction Act, but Article 43, para.1 of the Moneylending Act shall not apply to such receipt, the moneylender shall be presumed to be a "beneficiary in bad faith" set forth in Article 704 of the Civil Code, unless the moneylender has believed that Article 43, para.1 of the said Act shall apply and has a special reason for asserting that it is unavoidable for the moneylender to have believed as such.

Where rules for the accident compensation mutual-aid insurance provide that compensation money shall be paid when "the insured person has suffered a bodily injury in a sudden and contingent event of external origin," and in addition to this provision, also provide that "compensation money shall not be paid for any injury caused by the insured person's disease," the person who claims payment of compensation money is only required to allege and prove that there is a reasonable causal relation between the event caused by a force from outside the body of the insured person and the injury suffered by the insured person, and the person is not required to allege and prove that the insured person's disease is not the cause of the injury suffered by the insured person.

The designer, constructor and construction supervisor involved in the construction of buildings shall, when constructing a building, bear the duty of care to ensure the fundamental safety necessary for a building, not only to the party to the contract but also to the building users including residents as well as neighbors and passers-by who are not in a contractual relationship with them, and if the negligence of this duty has resulted in defects in the building that undermine its fundamental safety, thereby infringing the life, body or property of residents, etc., the designer, etc. shall be liable under the tort provision of the Civil Code to pay damages caused by such defects, unless there are special circumstances where, for example, the person claiming the tort liability has purchased the building while knowing and taking into account the existence of the defects.

Where a basic contract has been concluded in which provision of loans and repayment of debts are expected to be repeated between the lender and the borrower, and in which it is provided that the amount of monthly repayment is fixed on the basis of the outstanding amount of loan debts as of the previous month and that the amount of interest for monthly repayment shall be calculated for the period from the date of payment in the previous month to the date of payment in the current month and based on the amount of principal that remains after repayment was made on the date of payment in the previous month, debt repayments under the basic contract are construed to be made for the entire amount borrowed under the contract. In such circumstances, it is reasonable to construe that the basic contract contains an (implied) agreement that if an overpayment occurs in the repayment of loan debts under the basic contract by paying interest that exceeds the limit set by the Interest Rate Restriction Act, and there is no other loan debt at the time of repayment, such overpayment shall be appropriated to the repayment of any new loan debt that arises later.
